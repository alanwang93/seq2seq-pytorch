Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...</s>Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.</s>Then you know how bravely your son met his death.</s>"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that?

And you were the last one to be with him.</s>Yes, I was...</s>Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.</s>But -- why?</s>Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.</s>Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his.

May I join your mind?</s>Of course...!</s>
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation.

The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.</s>Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.</s>But I am a captain.

You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.</s>When I go?</s>Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.</s>Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.</s>Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.</s>Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.

You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?</s>That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.</s>You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?</s>Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.</s>It was over with Bill before you ever came home.

During one of those two seconds.</s>You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.</s>Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.</s>Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?</s>Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.</s>Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.</s>I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.</s>Nice try, old girl.

Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?</s>Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!

Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it.

-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.

Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music.

She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.</s>That's ridiculous...</s>In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show.

My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:</s>Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.</s>

I wish you'd stop readin' them.</s>And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.</s>Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?</s>Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.</s>Honey, go back to sleep, please!</s>Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!</s>
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.</s>Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?</s>Haven't the faintest idea.</s>That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.</s>And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?</s>No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.</s>There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.</s>That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.</s>How do you do that?</s>Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.</s>
The Halfords have invited us again this year.</s>You want to go?</s>What do you think?</s>Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.</s>
Let it go, Claude.</s>I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.</s>
It's cool, but where's the water?</s>Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.</s>Y'all never use it?</s>Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.</s>

Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!</s>Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time.

They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows.

I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?</s>The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.</s>If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.</s>Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.</s>

This is the last time I come to this place.</s>Excuse me?</s>Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.</s>We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.</s>Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.</s>

You should be glad Max got you driving for me.</s>No coke tonight.  Right?</s>Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.</s>
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.</s>Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.</s>
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.</s>Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.</s>
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!</s>We're not aiming for the truck!</s>
You got the wrong window again, man.</s>Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?</s>
See you around.</s>Where are you going?</s>Home.</s>How do you know that's the way?</s>
I said I was sorry.</s>You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.</s>You're not funny. Ouch!</s>
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?</s>We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.</s>Did you?</s>Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.</s>
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.</s>Just like that?</s>Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.</s>How's that been?</s>It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.</s>
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--</s>I do.</s>Well, you're the only one.</s>
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!</s>Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...</s>
what?</s>Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.</s>No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.</s>I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.</s>What do you mean? What kind of person am I?</s>What kind of person?</s>
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?</s>What do you want, Biff?</s>Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.</s>The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?</s>Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --</s>What do you want, Biff?</s>Where's your old man?</s>
That was seriously warped, Veronica.</s>Uh-huh.</s>
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --</s>Don't worry about it.

You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?</s>None at this time, sir.</s>Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.</s>
Radar!</s>All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.</s>
There's always a chance they'll confess.</s>Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?</s>Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...</s>Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.</s>
Holy shit.</s>What did you put in all those ammo boxes?</s>
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.</s>What...?  What if I say no?</s>Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.</s>Why me?</s>They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.</s>
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?</s>The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.</s>
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.</s>How long you been doing this?</s>Five years.</s>Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?</s>You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.</s>You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.</s>I think I'd remember that.</s>Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?</s>Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.</s>I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.</s>Sure.</s>
Take some time off.</s>You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?</s>I don't know.</s>

But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.</s>How did Doctor Almack react to that?</s>He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.

He's gone, hasn't he?</s>No.  He's - no.</s>Oh God.  Oh God.</s>
Stop this. This isn't funny.</s>I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.</s>This isn't fucking funny, Dante!</s>I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?</s>
Why, that's an echo, sir!</s>You try it.</s>Me, sir?</s>Yeah.</s>
It's you.</s>The resemblance is... striking.</s>
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.</s>Thinking about Thorwald?</s>And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?</s>Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.</s>

Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.</s>And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.</s>When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.</s>
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?</s>Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.</s>No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-</s>
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!</s>There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.</s>

Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it?

Don't you?</s>
You're like your mother.  You love money.</s>Dad.</s>No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?</s>Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.</s>
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.</s>Why?</s>Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.</s>

What?</s>Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.</s>I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.</s>He's a good man, Tom is.

We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her.

There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?</s>If you really mean it, I will.</s>Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back.</s>
You've got to put this on.</s>Take laddie.</s>Huh?</s>Save Laddie first.</s>

You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.</s>Yes, I am. Basically I am.</s>

Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.</s>I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.</s>

I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?</s>Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.</s>Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you.

Fuck, it's freezing.</s>Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.</s>Oh, yeah.</s>Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.</s>Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?</s>It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."</s>So.</s>Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.</s>Why?</s>Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."</s>Yeah?</s>These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.</s>So what?</s>I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.</s>You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?</s>I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.</s>
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.</s>Why am I still troubled...</s>
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.</s>Congratulations.</s>From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents.

Hmm.</s>So?</s>So, we get the mother, we get the boy.</s>
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?</s>Those attitudes do not exist in me.</s>I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.</s>Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.</s>
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...</s>Is that possible?</s>Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.</s>Is that far from here?</s>About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.</s>Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...</s>Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.</s>You really must do me this one favor.</s>Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?</s>Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.</s>
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.</s>We must!</s>With no laser --</s>

You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.</s>Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.</s>
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.</s>But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.</s>I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.</s>Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.</s>The theatre?</s>That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?</s>Yes, of course.</s>You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—</s>The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .</s>
He said they're charging us with murder.</s>Eeuww.</s>And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.</s>Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?</s>
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.</s>A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!</s>You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.</s>
It's only a b-b-b-book...</s>A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?</s>

I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.</s>Do you think this will come in my time?</s>
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.</s>Tell me... what else did you have?</s>Well, a hat...</s>What was it like?</s>It was very silly....

That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....</s>And there?</s>Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.</s>They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.</s>You feel it, though.</s>Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.</s>What is it, Anna?</s>You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers.

You were good.</s>Real good.</s>

I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.

I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.</s>It's a trip, you know?

Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ...

She's dancing with me.</s>Crash, I didn't think you--</s>I'll learn.  C'mon--</s>
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?</s>What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.

That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?</s>I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.</s>

Ha!</s>Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?

He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!</s>Yeah, or cashing a check.</s>Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.</s>Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.</s>Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.</s>
It's wrong to just let them go.</s>Good morning, Lucy.</s>
You've got to fight from time to time.</s>Not true.</s>Or get eaten alive.</s>That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.</s>Phooey.</s>Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.</s>
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...</s>Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?</s>
Oh, my god.</s>Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.</s>How? When?</s>Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.</s>Jesus.</s>She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.</s>I haven't seen her in almost two years.</s>Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?</s>Number six.</s>You've had sex with a dead person.</s>I'm gonna go to her wake.</s>No, you're not.</s>Why not?</s>It's today.</s>What!?</s>Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.</s>Shit. What about tomorrow?</s>One night only. She's buried in the morning.</s>You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.</s>Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?</s>You hardly knew her!</s>True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.</s>Stop it. This is beneath even you.</s>I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.</s>You hate people.</s>But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?</s>Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.</s>If you go, I go.</s>She meant nothing to you!</s>She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.</s>I'm not taking you to this funeral.</s>I'm going with you.</s>I can't close the store.</s>You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!</s>Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.</s>

Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?</s>Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.</s>Talk about Segretti--</s>--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.</s>There were more then.</s>Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--</s>--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--</s>--don't you miss the grand scheme too.</s>How grand?</s>Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.</s>And Justice and FBI know all this?</s>Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.</s>Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?</s>I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...</s>
Look, he's temperamental.</s>Yeah, what if I am? What about it?</s>
Hi Brandon.</s>No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.</s>Oh.

Oh no.</s>Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!</s>
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?</s>No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.</s>
In vino veritas.</s>Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.</s>
Fletch, you want an apology?</s>You were going to can me, right?</s>Not really.</s>Not really?</s>I was upset.</s>I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.</s>Fletch.</s>
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.</s>Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.</s>Everyone's working an angle, right?</s>There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.</s>
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.</s>What's your name, Giant?</s>Karl.</s>Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.</s>You don't like it?</s>I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?</s>
We'll just be a minute.</s>Can I smoke?</s>
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.</s>Why don't we go together?</s>No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.</s>
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...</s>They are... with me...</s>
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird?

Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?</s>Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.</s>

You're strangely dressed... for a knight.</s>I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?</s>I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.</s>
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.</s>I'm not disturbed. By you.</s>My lady friend has a personality disorder.</s>She was just too young for you.</s>

To coincidence.</s>There's a casino in this hotel.</s>I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.</s>So why did you come to my casino?</s>I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.</s>First visit to London?</s>No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally</s>I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.</s>Near the casino.</s>In the casino.</s>Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.</s>Your father?</s>I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.</s>The debts.</s>And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.</s>And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.</s>That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?</s>We all came from Africa, supposedly.</s>Do you believe in astrology?</s>Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.</s>

Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.

Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.</s>Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.</s>It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.</s>I don't want it to be just one of our parties.</s>"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."</s>Like the last time.</s>No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.</s>Like the last time.</s>I wasn't finished.</s>Okay.</s>"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."</s>It's our anniversary, Panes.</s>I didn't hear me say tonight.</s>We're just feeling our way back.</s>"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."</s>You know it's true.</s>

Let me handle that.</s>I'm all right.</s>Sure, but I'd like to handle it.</s>
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.</s>Damn straight.</s>
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...</s>Jesus ...</s>The business has changed...</s>
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.</s>That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.</s>Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't.

Thank you.</s>You're such an asshole.</s>
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?</s>Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.</s>
What do you know about classical music?</s>Nothing.. Selling is selling.</s>Charlie. About last nights..</s>Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.</s>But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.</s>Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes.

It's not safe.</s>We have to help him.</s>
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.</s>Yes, he was.</s>

Who?</s>Mel Gordon.</s>I still don't understand --</s>From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.</s>
You remember what happened next?</s>I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --</s>-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?</s>

Driver!</s>Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --</s>Damnit, where's my car!</s>-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --</s>
Eric!</s>It won't hold!</s>
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...</s>What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...</s>

Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.</s>Okay.</s>Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.</s>
How's everything at the apartment?</s>Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --</s>I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?</s>You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.</s>I never thought he'd do it.</s>I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.</s>I guess so.</s>For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.</s>Yes.  You walking to the subway?</s>No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --</s>
Do you know who did this?</s>Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.</s>Think Eddie had something to do with it?</s>Doesn't look good.</s>

Gerald wants to see him first.</s>Shut up.</s>
Take your time.</s>What?</s>That's what it's about.</s>Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.</s>
Alright, Roach, see you around.</s>Sorry about today, man.</s>
Can I help you?</s>Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!</s>Kate? No, there’s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?</s>
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.</s>But everybody's having such a good time.</s>Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.</s>But I have no excuse to close it.</s>Find one.</s>
What's so great about Sweden?</s>It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.</s>
What's that?</s>A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.</s>
You tell me.</s>Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?</s>Yes.</s>Why?</s>To save lives.</s>So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?</s>
Not bad.</s>Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.</s>Terrific.</s>
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.</s>He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.</s>
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.</s>I can't screw.  I can't screw.</s>
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.</s>I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?</s>I can't believe you just said that.</s>Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?</s>Making things real rough for Hal.</s>

Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.</s>Your lover.</s>No, my beloved, my child.</s>If you say so. You are innocent.</s>I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.</s>She is.</s>But why?</s>I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.</s>Then blame the one who made her...</s>Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.</s>We want no quarrel with him.</s>It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.</s>Then I leave too.</s>
You'll never guess what's happened!!</s>What??</s>John has fallen in love with me!</s>That idiot boarder?</s>
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.</s>B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?</s>Christ! You do know it all!</s>No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.</s>Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.</s>You got the wrong man.</s>I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.</s>You killed him?</s>Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.</s>I'm sure you have</s>There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.</s>So how ...?</s>What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.</s>What has Tuttle done?</s>We suspect him of freelance subversion.</s>He's a freelance subversive?</s>He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.</s>
Yes, where?</s>In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.</s>Ah-ha.</s>
Lookit Kip. All grown up...</s>Hey, Donny --</s>
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.</s>I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.</s>

No, why?</s>He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.</s>
You found something?</s>Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.</s>What?</s>I'm not sure. A virus --</s>-- You saw this experiment?</s>What did it look like?</s>
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.</s>As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?</s>You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.</s>Under a cloud without cause, I take it.</s>Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.</s>Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.</s>What do you mean?</s>Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.</s>
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.</s>Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.</s>

Who the hell do I know in Kansas?</s>Greg McConnell.</s>The football stud?</s>He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.</s>It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.</s>I don't think that bothered him.</s>What do you mean?</s>Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.</s>Are you shitting me?</s>I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.</s>Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.</s>Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.</s>Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?</s>Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.</s>Outstanding.</s>Don't think it's not going to cost you.</s>No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?</s>
What happened to your big "assignment"?</s>What do you know about it?</s>As much as ever.  Nothing.</s>It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?</s>The hospital.</s>The hospital?

And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?</s>Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.</s>That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.</s>I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.</s>As long as you keep remembering why.</s>Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.</s>The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.</s>I understand that.</s>And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --</s>No, no, no, no.</s>On the contrary -- this is tremendous.

There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?</s>I don't know.</s>I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.</s>
I can't do this.</s>Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?</s>Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an...

You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?</s>So?</s>Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.</s>Lucky break!</s>Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.</s>Did you see anything in the files?</s>It was all in Czech wasn't it.</s>What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?</s>Yeah, somewhere?</s>Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.</s>Do you want me to see what's on them?</s>No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.</s>And if you're wrong.</s>Siberia.</s>What do you want me to do?</s>Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?</s>Yeah, Dave Walters.</s>Good, what's his number?</s>

She doesn't seem to like you very much.</s>Oh, I don't mind.

Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?</s>Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?</s>Open it.</s>
How long have you been doing this?</s>Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.</s>Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?</s>This is my way of telling you --</s>What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?</s>

Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...</s>No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.</s>
Tormented -- ? Why?</s>I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.</s>Then you found the leopard --</s>I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --</s>
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...</s>We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.</s>
Thank you.</s>May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?</s>I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.</s>Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?</s>I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.</s>Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.</s>It is a little coarse, yes.</s>Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --</s>I have!</s>You have, yes.</s>No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.</s>Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.</s>Absolutely.</s>I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?</s>Tomorrow.</s>

What the hell's goin' on?</s>You gotta go back out there.</s>Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.</s>Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?</s>Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?</s>You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.</s>
Well, let's get to work!</s>You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?</s>Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.</s>
Hi.</s>Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.</s>Excuse me.</s>In the new library there.</s>Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?</s>Depends how you define 'new'...</s>You're the kid who was home schooled.</s>Yeah. How'd you know?</s>I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.</s>Four colors? Neato!</s>Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.

Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!</s>Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.</s>
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us.

And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?</s>So, you must be the Red Dragon.</s>
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.</s>Really.</s>What’s in it for me?

So, what brings you to a dive like this?</s>It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.</s>How old, kid?</s>
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --</s>Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!</s>Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!</s>He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him?

What are you talking about?</s>Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.</s>

So...</s>Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?</s>I guess.</s>Well, I'll see ya.</s>

You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.</s>Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?</s>Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.</s>Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.</s>What do you mean?</s>I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.</s>

What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?</s>Thank you.</s>I don't mean Fernando.</s>Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."</s>I never said that.</s>You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.</s>I felt that you could do better for yourself--</s>What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--</s>I never said that. It was just that boy--</s>"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!</s>
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?</s>Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.</s>What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.</s>The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.</s>We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.</s>Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.</s>

We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.</s>So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.</s>
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.</s>You want . . .

Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.</s>Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?</s>
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.</s>There's a lot of choices here.</s>No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.</s>I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!</s>
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.</s>They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.</s>

He had keys.</s>Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.</s>

But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?</s>Barzini.</s>Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.</s>
The winds are picking up.</s>On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?</s>

What are you selling?</s>Oh... it's a game.</s>A game?</s>Tailored specifically to each participant.

Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.</s>

Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.</s>I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.</s>As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.</s>

He will look like one of them.</s>He'll be weightless.</s>Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.</s>He will be odd, different.</s>Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.</s>

And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...</s>Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.

I'd forgotten.</s>Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.</s>Really?</s>You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."</s>Sorry.</s>
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?</s>Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.</s>I thought that was only for bombs.</s>No. It's for a lot of other things, too.</s>You think it can go faster than an F- 36?</s>Yes -- I think so.</s>

I'm sorry, ma'am?</s>Cold is good!</s>Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...</s>Why am I being lectured in this way?!</s>Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--</s>I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....</s>

By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.</s>

The price she would pay for her teenage lust.</s>After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.</s>Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.</s>Wouldn't we all.</s>
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?</s>Naw, I made it, Carl made it.</s>

You think I'm an asshole.</s>Didn't know you read minds.</s>I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.

Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.</s>It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</s>
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?</s>No, Dad.</s>Are you sure?</s>Yes, Dad.</s>

John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.</s>Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?</s>Someone will find me.</s>Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.</s>You idiot!  You'll kill us both!</s>At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?</s>For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!</s>What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?

I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.</s>What the hell is this?</s>The freeway.</s>I know that. There are people in some of these cars.</s>It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.</s>
What is that?</s>Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?</s>
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...</s>Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.</s>
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care.

There is no direct evidence, no.</s>And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?</s>I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.</s>In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.</s>By our standards... yes.</s>

Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.</s>It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...</s>

Any parting words of wisdom?</s>Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?</s>
What?</s>Well, do you?</s>Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."</s>Nice.</s>

Anyone know what time it is?</s>3:30.</s>
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.</s>That's frustrating.</s>It's so frustrating.</s>

Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?</s>For the moment.</s>And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!</s>
Just don't show fear.</s>I don't know what's going on.</s>It lends you an air of mystery.</s>
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.</s>I would completely support that.</s>
You saved me from the arrow...</s>But not from your destiny.</s>I want to thank you.</s>That's not why you came.</s>
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?</s>Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.</s>

Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?</s>Stressed? He's psycho.</s>
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.</s>I just - hate it when they're - finished.</s>
One purse--  empty. One vanity case--</s>But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.</s>Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--</s>Oh! You didn't read it!</s>Naturally I did.</s>Oh!</s>You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.</s>M'sieu Laval!</s>But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.</s>What's wrong now?</s>With your skin, I prefer crimson.</s>Too much blue in crimson.</s>That's what you need!</s>No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--</s>What shade of powder do you use?</s>Peaches and cream.</s>That's too dark.</s>Do you realize I have light eyes?</s>But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.</s>
No.</s>Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?</s>Ha un numero di telefono?</s>
Nervous?</s>Yes.  I don't like this.</s>Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?</s>Two wavy lines?</s>Sorry.  This isn't your day.</s>
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.</s>You paid $50,000 for your character?</s>I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.</s>What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?</s>Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.</s>
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?</s>Bingo.</s>

He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.</s>Sir?</s>We’ve got him!</s>
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.</s>Let's just see if he can make it into round two....</s>
You're kidding me.</s>As Charlie Steinway is my witness.</s>Peggy Lee?</s>Tell her.</s>
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.</s>Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.</s>I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.</s>Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.</s>Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.</s>I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.</s>Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?</s>I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?</s>That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.</s>Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!</s>
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.</s>We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.</s>That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?</s>
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...</s>I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?</s>

Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.</s>The hell with 'em.</s>

I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.</s>I don't think I want any.</s>I do.</s>

Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?</s>Big.Com. That Internet thing.</s>Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.</s>Sort of like a letter of intent.</s>Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.</s>And you have this letter of intent?</s>Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.</s>
This is your doing?</s>Yes, they had nothing to do with it.</s>And you broke into that room?</s>That's right.</s>You will wish you hadn't.</s>Fuck you!</s>
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?</s>Watch and see.</s>
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.</s>That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?</s>Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.</s>Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?</s>No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.</s>I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.</s>Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.</s>
Isn't it?</s>That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --</s>Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.</s>How many tickets can I put you down for?</s>None.  Christ!</s>You're not even coming?</s>Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!</s>So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?</s>Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.</s>
That's a lot of people to die unknown.</s>Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.</s>
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.</s>Don't fuck with me, Beth.</s>I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.</s>
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?</s>Why?</s>Because you're coming home.</s>Why don't you just take me back without it?</s>Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.</s>
Hey! Where are you going?!</s>Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!</s>No, but you sucked enough dick!</s>Yeah, I went down on a few guys...</s>A few?</s>...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!</s>Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!</s>Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.</s>I feel sick.</s>I love you. Don't feel sick.</s>Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.</s>
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.</s>But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—</s>Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?</s>But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—</s>Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.</s>
It's good.</s>God, I want to go home.</s>Hey, you know you can't this in France.</s>
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.</s>You just did.</s>I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.</s>

That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.</s>Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?</s>
He's not like other guys.</s>He's decent.</s>He's kind.</s>

She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.</s>Where's she at?</s>Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.</s>She took them kids with her?</s>Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!</s>Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!</s>
Do you want me to stop calling?</s>Look, I'll call you, okay?</s>
But it IS! Look!</s>The important thing is not to panic.</s>
Huh?</s>Moisture! Moisture!</s>
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?</s>I can't work this.</s>We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.</s>But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?</s>Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.</s>My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.</s>Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.</s>
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.</s>Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.</s>But Superman isn't an average man.</s>And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.</s>
That's two bucks, Joe.</s>Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?</s>Okay, I will.</s>
No.  Look, we're kind of....</s>That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.</s>Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?</s>Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...</s>
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?</s>I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.</s>Me too.  I was afraid.</s>
Do you think that Wynant did it?</s>Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.</s>
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.</s>I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.</s>Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.</s>May I ask why?</s>We were having a little talk.</s>About what?</s>Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.</s>I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?</s>Mr. Gardner, I --</s>You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?</s>Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.</s>I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.</s>Of course.</s>
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.</s>I hope you're ready for this.</s>
I don't see why not.</s>Because it's illegal.</s>Holding hands?</s>No, not holding hands.</s>In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.</s>And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.</s>
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.</s>Of course, of course, of course.</s>
...Well, I'm not sure where I --</s>I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!</s>But look, I'm president of the company now and I --</s>I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!</s>
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!</s>Or it might be the firing squad!</s>Or we can't go back to Russia!</s>
</s>What's going on, colonel?</s>Here's what I want you to do.</s>
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.</s>A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.</s>Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.</s>Wait a second there brother...</s>No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.</s>
Maurice?</s>Yes.</s>If I die, you'll know where to look for me?</s>Go to sleep Ellen.</s>No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?</s>
Mr. Dawson, I --</s>Jack.</s>Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.</s>Well, here you are.</s>Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.</s>You're welcome. Rose.</s>Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?</s>That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.</s>I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!</s>Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.</s>Oh God, I am such an utter fool.</s>That penguin last night, is he one of them?</s>Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.</s>Is he your boyfriend?</s>Worse I'm afraid.</s>
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!</s>Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!</s>The mountains?</s>
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.</s>And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.</s>I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?</s>
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.</s>Ha.</s>
Forgot your keys --</s>That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.</s>
Yo! That jacket is tight.</s>Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!</s>Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!</s>Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.</s>
I can see why they sent you along.</s>So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?</s>
Were you Longe Range Recon --</s>No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.</s>
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...</s>Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?</s>I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.</s>I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...</s>
Only one guys checked in?</s>Yeah.</s>C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.</s>
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?</s>No sir...pleasure.</s>In that case, give the boys room...</s>
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.</s>I'll always go back to that church.</s>So one day we'll meet.</s>

I got her arm.</s>Here's his head.</s>
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.</s>It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.</s>I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.</s>
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.</s>Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.</s>You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.</s>I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...</s>
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?</s>Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.</s>Go on.</s>
I thought you said you were crap.</s>I had to say something to get you here.</s>Fair enough, but I’m stepping on toes here and you’re waltzing around like...</s>
Yeah? How's our new witness?</s>D'you find the obstetric nurse?</s>She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...</s>Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.</s>
What do you want?</s>A little Charlie, perhaps.</s>Coke?</s>I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.</s>That shouldn't be a problem.</s>
Too bad you didn't have a machine.</s>There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.</s>
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.</s>You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --</s>
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?</s>Cereal.</s>Yeah?</s>Go fix the phones.</s>Roger.</s>
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.</s>Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?</s>
You follow me out here for a reason?</s>Yeah, I did.</s>
You'd like that?</s>Intensely.</s>But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?</s>It would bring us together.</s>You and Regan?</s>You and us.</s>
What about you?</s>I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?</s>I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.</s>Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.</s>Szpilman.</s>Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.</s>

A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.</s>Who was talking about what?</s>
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.</s>What about the gold?</s>What about it?</s>Maybe we should split it up now.</s>We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.</s>What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.</s>
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?</s>I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?</s>Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.</s>Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.</s>It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.</s>
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?</s>No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...</s>
Hey, buddy...</s>Relax, let technology do the work.</s>
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?</s>Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.</s>Ma'am?</s>From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?</s>I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.</s>Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.</s>
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.</s>Aye, sir.</s>I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...</s>Understood, sir.</s>Dismiss the company.</s>
No, don't do that...</s>Shut up...</s>
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.</s>What do we know about the population?</s>
Did you see anyone else down here?</s>No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.</s>
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.</s>I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.</s>C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.</s>
You must've had a reason to ask me that.</s>No. I'm just a snoop.</s>You seem to have had a reason for every other question.</s>No, not for that one.</s>I don't believe you.</s>
What the hell is going on?!</s>I wish I knew.</s>
It's our job, Gloria.</s>Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.</s>
Is he chasing us?</s>I don't know.</s>
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.</s>Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --</s>Front page?</s>Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.</s>
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.</s>Camel jockey.</s>You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.</s>Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.</s>
Do I look all right?</s>None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.</s>I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...</s>Perhaps this will help.</s>
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...</s>One false move and I'll blow your heads off!</s>
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?</s>Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.</s>Well, nobody asked yuh.</s>Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!</s>
...<u>sadly</u>...</s>Hey, lost again.</s>But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.</s>I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.</s>His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling...</s>The great and <u>beautiful</u>...</s>Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...</s>No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.</s>Thank you.</s>Or clear your windshield with it.</s>...what a lovely perfume.</s>Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...</s>
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.</s>I'm thinking.</s>So think already.</s>
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.</s>Movies?</s>Yes, I photograph very well. Look --</s>
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.</s>But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.</s>
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?</s>Yes.</s>Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?</s>Yes.</s>Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?</s>Oh, God.</s>Do you see?</s>Please, no.</s>'No' what?</s>Not me.</s>Are you a man?</s>Yes.</s>Do you imply that I'm a queer?</s>God, no.</s>Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?</s>No.</s>
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."</s>All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.</s>What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.</s>Are you really that brave?</s>I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.</s>It's just as I thought.</s>What?</s>
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.</s>Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.</s>
You want these people.</s>These people, my people, I want my people.</s>
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.</s>Bruce?  What are you doing?</s>
Hold this.</s>What?</s>The wheel.</s>
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.</s>We'd be the first!</s>
Thanks to you, Nate.</s>Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.</s>
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.</s>Thanks, Principal Merkin.</s>I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.</s>Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.</s>Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.</s>You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?</s>That's a good start, yes. A very good start.</s>Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.</s>I never figured you for a pimp.</s>Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"</s>What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.</s>I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?</s>
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.</s>I've got something for you.</s>
Wh-- Wha--</s>Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.</s>Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --</s>
I vote for the motel.</s>My kinda group!</s>
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.</s>"Another man?" Who?</s>
What's the problem?</s>He wants to put a half million on Syphon.</s>
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.</s>And why's that?</s>He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.</s>
I managed.</s>You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?</s>
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.</s>Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!</s>
You must help us.</s>We don't HAVE to help anybody.</s>Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.</s>Why should WE care?</s>Because... you're... you're the Gods....</s>So?</s>Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.</s>
As you say, Doctor.</s>He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?</s>
Tell me...</s>I love you...</s>
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."</s>Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.</s>
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.</s>You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.</s>
And again.  How would you get him on land?</s>That's actually the easy part.</s>
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.</s>I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.</s>I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --</s>Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.</s>Mr. Sheldrake?</s>That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.</s>You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.</s>I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --</s>Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.</s>Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --</s>I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?</s>
It's a beautiful dress...</s>I know.</s>
How are you, Benjamin?</s>Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.</s>
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...</s>Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...</s>The purpose being...?</s>
She said I have a son...</s>No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.</s>
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...</s>Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?</s>
So what is it you want to know?</s>I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.</s>Created?</s>Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.</s>Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.</s>You seem one to me.</s>A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.</s>
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?</s>I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.</s>I'll set John on you!</s>Oh, anything you say, Paul.</s>
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -</s>It's ok, boy.</s>
Kaggs. Home office.</s>Roy Dillon.</s>I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.</s>
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.</s>Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.</s>
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...</s>Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.</s>
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?</s>Sir... I guess I do, sir.</s>
I guess I left it in my room.</s>What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.</s>
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.</s>No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.</s>
What if it doesn't come back?</s>I told you.  You need to rest.</s>
Hurry up and get dressed.</s>I'm coming.</s>I'm going with you.</s>
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.</s>You want me to place a few calls?</s>
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?</s>Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.</s>
Engines off.</s>Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.</s>
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.</s>Chapin did contact you then?</s>Sure--off the record.</s>On the orders of Haldeman?</s>I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.</s>It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.</s>Can't help you.</s>At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?</s>
I've got concerns.</s>...About what?</s>About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.</s>I'm not doing cocaine.</s>Buddy, I'm not an ethics professor, I'm a physician, be honest, or be dead within a day... s'your choice.</s>
Forget me.  If you can, get away.</s>Would you?</s>
Congratulations.</s>Thanks.</s>So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?</s>I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?</s>
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.</s>Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.</s>Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.</s>Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.</s>Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.</s>Seriously?</s>Seriously.</s>Great.</s>

If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?</s>I don't know. Probably not.</s>Jill's really great, isn't she?</s>Great... so how's everything with you?</s>
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.</s>Annie's a smart lady.</s>
I never made it to Korea.</s>But you said --</s>-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.</s>I see.</s>
What's wrong with you?</s>You wanted to tussle, we tussled.</s>
What do you want?</s>Conklin.</s>He's dead.</s>
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?</s>The American? Yes, duck.</s>How did he look?</s>What do you mean, 'how did he look'?</s>You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?</s>I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.</s>Thank you.</s>
It's TV heaven.</s>I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.</s>Let's try out the bed.</s>
No!</s>I'm sorry, John.</s>No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!</s>I have to go away, John.</s>Don't do it.  Please... don't go --</s>
Good evening, sir.</s>Good evening.</s>It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.</s>Of course. Food alright?</s>Great, sir. Great.</s>Try the wine!</s>Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.</s>Won't you join me, sir?</s>No, my health doesn't allow it.</s>And you, sir?</s>
The weed.</s>But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?</s>They said he's a drug dealer.</s>
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.</s>Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.</s>
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?</s>Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.</s>
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.</s>We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?</s>Well. I'm going home.</s>
There is?</s>For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...</s>
It's getting pretty late. We better go.</s>Yeah...</s>
An experimental device, doctor.</s>Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...</s>
How much does this cost?</s>Two thousand francs.</s>A week?</s>A day.</s>Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?</s>A cow?</s>Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?</s>
Where to, madame?</s>Can you recommend a restaurant?</s>Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...</s>Where do you eat?</s>At Père Mathieu's.</s>Where is that?</s>It's just a place for workmen.</s>Where is it?</s>Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.</s>
It's the Genesis Wave!</s>What?</s>He's on a build up to detonation!</s>How soon --</s>We encoded four minutes --</s>We'll beam aboard and stop it --</s>You can't!</s>

We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.</s>... without a shred of manners.</s>
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?</s>Mm hmm.</s>
Yes, sir.</s>Have you notified the police?</s>No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .</s>
Damn.</s>What's wrong?</s>I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.</s>
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...</s>I want a job, Giles.</s>All right. As what?</s>I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?</s>We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?</s>
What's wrong, Danny?</s>Look, maybe you oughta' leave.</s>
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?</s>All set.</s>
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.</s>Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.</s>Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.</s>
Do you understand me you little fuck?</s>Yes, Mr. Vesci.</s>And John, don't make me come look for you.</s>
What're your taking down?</s>Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.</s>
Well...</s>It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...</s>
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.</s>It's what I'm countin' on.</s>
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.</s>Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.</s>
What is Bruce doing ?</s>I don't know.....</s>
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?</s>Sure, what do you want to know?</s>Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?</s>Ours is not to reason why.</s>Huh?</s>Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.</s>I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.</s>Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.</s>Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.</s>
That's not funny.</s>That was great!</s>
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."</s>The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.</s>What am I -- a dog, now?</s>
Yes.</s>How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.</s>Okay.</s>
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.</s>You collect these to sell, abroad?</s>
Blade --</s>You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.</s>
That was beautiful.</s>I taught you that.</s>I can play the piano?</s>Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.</s>
Yeah, this place is great.</s>Yeah.</s>
What happened to Shelly?</s>She just had a baby that's all.</s>We have a baby?</s>Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.</s>Can I see him?</s>You can do anything you want. You're his sister.</s>
Oh yeah?</s>You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?</s>Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.</s>Am I bothering you?</s>No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?</s>Yes.</s>How is Central these days?</s>Terrible boring.</s>What else is new? Right?</s>Yeah. What are you doing now?</s>I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.</s>That's too bad.</s>What do you know about the ear? Anything?</s>Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?</s>Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?</s>I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.</s>Do you know who was brought in for questioning?</s>There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.</s>Were all these people questioned this afternoon?</s>No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.</s>The ear is from a missing person maybe?</s>Maybe so.</s>It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?</s>Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.</s>I guess you have to get back home soon?</s>Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.</s>
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...</s>Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!</s>Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...</s>Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!</s>
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.</s>Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.</s>I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.</s>
I was looking for you.</s>I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.</s>Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?</s>
You're a good liar.</s>Almost as good as you.</s>I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.</s>
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...</s>Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?</s>
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.</s>Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?</s>Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?</s>Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?</s>Charming. More delightful people crippled.</s>Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.</s>Meaning what?</s>That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.</s>
I do sort of live with somebody though.</s>Oh.</s>
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?</s>Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.</s>
Well, go on! Go berserk!</s>GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!</s>
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.</s>Did you meet Captain Kirk?</s>You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.</s>
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.</s>Yes.</s>
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?</s>Not through any help of yours, Hildy.</s>Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --</s>
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?</s>I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.</s>Go on, you're tired.</s>No, I'm fine, thanks.</s>
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.</s>This is the place.</s>Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.</s>
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.</s>So you were never a prostitute?</s>What are you asking me?</s>I'm just trying to find out who you are.</s>
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!</s>I can't stand here doing nothing!</s>
You'll be sitting on the right.</s>I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."</s>Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.</s>
Great.  Who is it...?</s>"Room Service!"</s>Would you go in...</s>
Joey... Which way's aft?</s>That way.</s>
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.</s>There are some things... better left unsaid.</s>You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!</s>
I am irate!</s>But...</s>But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.</s>I know it! Please believe me, I know that...</s>
Just tell me his title.</s>I don't know titles.</s>Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?</s>
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?</s>You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.</s>
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...</s>And you're a nice man, Quince.</s>Thanks.</s>You're welcome.</s>
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.</s>Why's that?</s>
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.</s>I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.</s>Oh, it is?</s>Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.</s>
Relax, Seymour, relax...</s>That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...</s>

He waited for you three hours!</s>You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --</s>I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.</s>Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --</s>It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--</s>Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?</s>He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.</s>Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?</s>
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!</s>Stay away from me, mister!</s>
Please.  Don't do anything.</s>Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.</s>I can't believe this.</s>Believe it.</s>
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?</s>I kinda doubt it.</s>
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.</s>Absolutely.</s>
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.</s>If you want to, you can call your lawyer.</s>These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.</s>
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.</s>Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?</s>I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?</s>
I never saw it before.</s>Positive?</s>
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.</s>It's a bet--come on, Sally!</s>
Are there snakes out here?</s>They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.</s>Doesn't the isolation bother you?</s>Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.</s>You love him?</s>No.</s>Did you ever?</s>Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.</s>Is that why you're with him?</s>I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?</s>I'm guessing no.</s>Yeah, I guess you're right.</s>I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.</s>I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?</s>
Five minutes.</s>What?</s>I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.</s>See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.</s>The caramel thing is my pick-up line.</s>
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?</s>Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.</s>
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?</s>Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?</s>Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...</s>
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.</s>He just gave me his "monster" speech.</s>That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking.</s>
Frankie, I --</s>-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.</s>
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.</s>Yeah. Hey, Clay.</s>
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?</s>I don't think so.</s>
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?</s>Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.</s>
Slow down. Smell that?</s>Smoke.</s>Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.</s>
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.</s>Then do as you're told. Get her back.</s>
Yield *how*, sir?</s>Will he yield for a question?</s>Ah, now, that's better.</s>Will he *yield*?</s>For a *question*.</s>Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?</s>It does!</s>Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--</s>Mr. President--</s>I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?</s>I have no defense against forged papers and--</s>The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!</s>
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.</s>This babe has said enough.</s>

Do it again.</s>In time.</s>No now.</s>In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?</s>
Why'd you let him get to you?</s>Who?</s>Dorsey.</s>I hate him.</s>I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.</s>Hey man. . .

No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.</s>All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.</s>
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?</s>It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.</s>

It's a mystery.</s>

Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.</s>What? -- go on --</s>
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?</s>I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats.

Like a moth to a flame.</s>Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?</s>Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.</s>Neuter a locust, feed the world.</s>
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.</s>I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.</s>Tomorrow morning.</s>No -- now.</s>Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.</s>
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.</s>I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.</s>The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.</s>
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.</s>Is she?</s>
We shall attack at once.</s>Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!</s>
I'm scared shitless.</s>That's okay.  I love you anyway.</s>
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.</s>What are you talking about?</s>You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.</s>How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!</s>All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.</s>
I embellished.</s>"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?</s>I embroidered.</s>"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?</s>I lied.</s>
We did it, Ray.</s>You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.</s>
Yeah?</s>One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.</s>
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.</s>You wanted to share this moment with me.</s>It stands so still.</s>Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.</s>I can sea its breath in the cold.</s>It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.</s>May I pet the deer?</s>It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.</s>I want to touch it.</s>
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--</s>It was Big Dave's.</s>--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.</s>*I* was with her.</s>
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.</s>Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?</s>
Hey, Mikey!</s>Hi, Dad!</s>Come here, give me a hug!</s>Gee, you're home early!</s>Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.</s>Sure, Dad.</s>
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...</s>The cockpit? What is it?</s>It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?</s>
Hey, man, good to see you.</s>This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.</s>
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.</s>You gave them me.</s>I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.</s>
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.</s>I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...</s>Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...</s>
You all right, Mama?</s>I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.</s>We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?</s>No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?</s>
Atonement.</s>Who are all these people?</s>
They're not really going to call security are they?</s>No, I don't think so.</s>How do I get out of here?</s>Follow me.</s>You talked me into it.</s>
You were eavesdropping.</s>No I wasn't.</s>What did you hear?</s>Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.</s>Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.</s>
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.</s>That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.</s>
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.</s>I know, I know.</s>See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.</s>
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.</s>Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.</s>
You called, Doctor?</s>Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.</s>How come?</s>I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.</s>And what else is bothering you?</s>... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.</s>Yeah, you really don't like him.</s>I don't like what he does.</s>It's his work.</s>He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.</s>Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?</s>I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?</s>Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?</s>No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.</s>Not enough loving.</s>Get out of here!</s>
Well... that's my business, madame.</s>That's no business... that's a social injustice.</s>That depends on the tip.</s>
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.</s>You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?</s>
Does Jahn's thing have a name?</s>Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?</s>
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?</s>A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.</s>Don't tell me they're refueling...</s>Oxygenation...</s>
Lisa Sherman?</s>Yeah. Who is she?</s>I don't know. Where did you hear that name.</s>I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.</s>What?</s>That's what he said.</s>Did he say anything else about her?</s>No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.</s>I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.</s>No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.</s>Not that I know of.</s>
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.</s>Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...</s>
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?</s>Who?</s>The kid. Junior.</s>Gone.</s>I must have frightened her away.</s>I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.</s>Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...</s>Don't mix your metaphors.</s>I mix what I like.</s>Okay. Mix.</s>I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.</s>What a body, what a voice.</s>The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!</s>The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.</s>I will not calm down!</s>Don't calm down.</s>You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?</s>I'm trying terribly hard.</s>Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!</s>Here we go...</s>Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-</s>Now don't get carried away-</s>- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!</s>You've been all through that with Lloyd-</s>The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!</s>I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!</s>Paranoiac!</s>I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!</s>Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...</s>
How about it?</s>I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...</s>
We've got problems here.</s>Problems?</s>
Mr. President, this is St...</s>Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...</s>
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.</s>I see...</s>
Come <i>on</i>.</s>Shit.</s>What?</s>They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.</s>From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.</s>And then they'll kill 'em.</s>At least.</s>
You're gonna love it.</s>How much we got left in that minigun?</s>
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."</s>What Scar? What fucking scar?</s>AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.</s>
No hash browns?</s>Not in the mood, I guess.</s>But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?</s>Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.</s>Suit yourself, I guess.</s>
Helping you -- I just --</s>No one ever helps me. It's my job.</s>
What a beautiful day.</s>Perfect for a swim, isn't it?</s>
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.</s>I'm sure.</s>I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.</s>
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.</s>A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?</s>
So, you're looking great, how have you been?</s>Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.</s>Really?</s>My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.</s>Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.</s>
You still there?</s>Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.</s>
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.</s>The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.</s>We all know what right is, Senator.</s>
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.</s>Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.</s>That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...</s>... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...</s>I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.</s>How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?</s>The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.</s>Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?</s>There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...</s>A planet in Federation space...</s>Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.</s>Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.</s>On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...</s>Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.</s>With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?</s>There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...</s>The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.</s>Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.</s>Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.</s>Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...</s>It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?</s>The Ba'ku.</s>
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.</s>I took a cab.</s>You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?</s>Sure. Why not?</s>Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.</s>What time is it?</s>'Bout twelve.</s>I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?</s>No. Not particularly.  How come?</s>Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?</s>I love to get pie after a movie.</s>Would you like to get some pie?</s>I'd love some pie.</s>
Are you sure you saw something?</s>How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.</s>Well, why haven't they answered our flares?</s>

Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.</s>No, no ... I did that...</s>
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.</s>Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.</s>Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.</s>You afraid of the dark?</s>Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.</s>So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?</s>More or less.</s>Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.</s>Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.</s>No and I don't plan on sticking around either.</s>Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.</s>You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.</s>
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?</s>Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.</s>What kind of school?</s>School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.</s>So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.</s>
Is he awake?</s>I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.</s>Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.</s>
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.</s>What kind of personnel?</s>
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.</s>Oh sure.  Of course.</s>
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.</s>You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.</s>I lied.</s>All the more reason I should be here.</s>Please.  It's for your own good.</s>You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.</s>
What is it?  What are you?</s>There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!</s>
Operator.</s>Tank, it's me.</s>
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?</s>Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!</s>I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...</s>You sure are a pretty lady.</s>
I'm not finished yet.</s>Go on...</s>'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.</s>Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!</s>Yeah?</s>Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.</s>The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!</s>
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.</s>Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?</s>I didn't mean to make a fool of you.</s>Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.</s>But I love you.</s>You say that over and over but you don't even know me!</s>
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.</s>Don't you live at home?</s>No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.</s>I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.</s>I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.</s>
Best in the Fleet !</s>I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?</s>
What's left over?'</s>Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.</s>What about all the gear?</s>
Where's the stiff?</s>Come on. Be polite.</s>
This is either crazy, or brilliant.</s>Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.</s>
Beautiful night.</s>Yeah.</s>Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.</s>No problem. What's on your mind?</s>Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?</s>Whatever.</s>A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?</s>Sure.</s>Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?</s>I agree with what you said...truly.</s>What did I say?</s>That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.</s>So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.</s>How's that?</s>
Michael...</s>No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.</s>Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...</s>The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.</s>
I want that fucker dead.</s>I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.</s>Are you saying she liked it?</s>I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.</s>

Agent Novak?</s>Peter, okay?</s>Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?</s>
Oh, boy!</s>Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!</s>
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.</s>So?</s>So, that occurred to me.</s>
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.</s>Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.</s>By whose authority?</s>My own.</s>
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!</s>Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?</s>
Yes, you!</s>Well, you do have the dress.</s>And the church.</s>And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.</s>I'm okay with that.</s>So am I.</s>So, we'll...</s>
You're out of your mind.</s>What's your point?</s>I will do no such thing.</s>Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.</s>
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.</s>All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?</s>Nine.</s>Nine?</s>Nine!</s>Big feet.</s>
Uhh, yeah it does.</s>You stay out of this, Bob.</s>
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --</s>You can't threaten me --</s>
What?</s>I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.</s>
Speak up.</s>It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.</s>
Open the door, will ya?</s>Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?</s>Open the door. We're late.</s>I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.</s>What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.</s>

Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.</s>Cheers, Terrance!</s>
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -</s>I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!</s>
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?</s>What about it?</s>Any idea where it is?</s>Little place called "Williams," why?</s>I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?</s>I know plenty.</s>
Shush, Adele.</s>Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.</s>
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.</s>You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.</s>

Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.</s>Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.</s>
Don't, Lee--that's dead.</s>Let's see if I can bring it back to life.</s>

Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --</s>We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.</s>
Thank you.  Thank you very much.</s>I believe in miracles now.</s>
So who are you?</s>What do you mean?</s>Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?</s>I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.</s>Yeah, well, that's what I do too.</s>What?</s>Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?</s>Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?</s>Of course it does.</s>
Look, Co...</s>Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!</s>
Weren't you expecting us?</s>That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?</s>
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?</s>Have a look.  At nothing.</s>
Just give me a minute.</s>Is there a problem?</s>That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.</s>
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.</s>You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.</s>You're terrible.</s>I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.</s>
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!</s>Share the love, Tits!</s>
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.</s>If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...</s>

It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.</s>Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.</s>
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.</s>No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.</s>
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?</s>Honey?</s>Mm.</s>
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.</s>It's too late. The movie's made</s>They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--</s>You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!</s>I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.</s>
I got an awful toothache.</s>Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.</s>But I don't know who they are.</s>

Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.</s>I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.</s>Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?</s>
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!</s>Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -</s>No.</s>
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.</s>Thank you.</s>He's my brother...</s>

Hey, pretty nifty, huh?</s>You ain't gonna get me to stay here.</s>Sure, you are.</s>No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.</s>
Oh, Jesus, really?</s>Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?</s>What?</s>
You'd best take a swim, Jack.</s>The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.</s>

Get more snatch by the batch!</s>I wrote that.</s>You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?</s>They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.</s>
Give men that. I know how to do it.</s>Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?</s>Almost.</s>
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --</s>-- Thank you.</s>By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.</s>Yes.</s>I believe you have a message for him?</s>Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?</s>
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?</s>Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...</s>
How is he?</s>He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.</s>How much time does he have left?</s>You don't talk about those things. Not yet.</s>
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.</s>For me, I think such a mix is crucial.</s>Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.</s>

Tell me about it.</s>About...</s>About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.</s>Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'</s>
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.</s>...don't feel like it either.</s>...beautiful night.</s>Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.</s>That's a nice way of putting it.</s>

I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.</s>

My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.</s>
I'm sorry, George...</s>You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!</s>
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?</s>My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.</s>Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?</s>No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.</s>May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.</s>Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.</s>If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?</s>If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.</s>
What do you want?</s>I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.</s>About what?</s>You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?</s>So?</s>In the sight of God that is a sin.</s>What do you want?</s>Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.</s>Leave me alone.</s>I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.</s>Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?</s>That makes no difference.

Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.</s>How well are you trained in music?</s>I know a little.

That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....</s>

Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.</s>She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?</s>

I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.</s>She didn't even know you. .</s>I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.</s>Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.</s>Hey, I was workin' her.

Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.</s>Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?</s>
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?</s>I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.</s>
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?</s>Of course.</s>
What would <u>that</u> be?</s>He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.

This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.</s>How's that possible?</s>Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.</s>
You must think I'm quite the madman.</s>The thought had crossed my mind.</s>The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.</s>

You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"</s>I notice you still remember it.</s>I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.</s>You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.</s>Done what?</s>Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.</s>Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.</s>Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.</s>I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.</s>Now, that's a nice thing to say.</s>Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?</s>Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.</s>A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.</s>Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.</s>What home?</s>
We're leaving.</s>You can't, your orders are specific...</s>"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.</s>You're insane. You've lost your mind.</s>Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.</s>Don't... don't do this...</s>It's done.</s>

At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?</s>36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.</s>I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours.

Are we agreed?</s>
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.</s>You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.

Two hundred.</s>Two hundred pounds?</s>Two hundred pounds.</s>You paid two hundred pounds for this?</s>That's what it cost, David.</s>No, no, no. That's what you paid for it.

If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?</s>

Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.</s>If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.</s>Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.

I didn't even have to coax her tonight.</s>That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.</s>Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.</s>
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.</s>All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?</s>

I knew him when I was still in school.</s>What did he want?</s>I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.</s>
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.</s>It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.</s>
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.</s>We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.</s>What would do that...?</s>What in the <u>world</u> would do that?</s>I'm working on it.</s>

Does "they" mean the White House?</s>As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.</s>The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?</s>No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.</s>And as treasurer, you could release those funds?</s>When so ordered.</s>We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five.</s>

What did she do next, Mr. Roston?</s>She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.</s>If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?</s>I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.

I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?</s>500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.</s>
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.</s>You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.</s>There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.</s>A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!</s>A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!</s>I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.</s>We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.</s>

Your witness.</s>

Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...</s>It's more than that.</s>

I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.</s>Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?</s>Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.</s>I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.</s>If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.</s>General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.</s>I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.</s>Proceed.</s>But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.</s>You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.</s>I have heard that story but I do not believe it.</s>Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.</s>The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.</s>For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.</s>Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?</s>Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.</s>You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.</s>I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.</s>Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.</s>Ah, yes -- proceed.</s>The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.</s>
I'm just practicing my lying.</s>Still needs work.</s>You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.</s>

What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?</s>No, sir.</s>No, sir, WHAT?</s>The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.</s>

Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.</s>She set them up. All of them.</s>Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?</s>And you set me up.</s>Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.</s>

Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural.

I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.</s>Do you get paid a lot?</s>That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it.

You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.</s>How?</s>The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus.

It was pretty late.</s>You work too hard, you know that?</s>Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.</s>Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.</s>If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.</s>That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?</s>If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.</s>Come on, just a little hint.</s>Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.</s>The inspiration.</s>Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?</s>No way.</s>All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.</s>The end.</s>No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.</s>

I should have never come back here after college.</s>Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...</s>

We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.</s>If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?</s>Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her.

She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.</s>A bad combination.</s>

I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.</s>
Did I ever tell you about my father?</s>I don't give a shit about-</s>He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.</s>

Do you want an aisle or a window seat?</s>Window.</s>Do you want a fruit plate?</s>I don't know.  Do I?</s>I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.</s>

And what happens if I don't call you?</s>I kill her anyway.</s>
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?</s>The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.</s>
Pritchett: what is going on?</s>He must've unsealed the room!</s>How, he's supposed to be dead!</s>

Kat, wait. I don’t want you hating me. We’ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.</s>Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.</s>Kat, stop it. You do. You can’t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.</s>
You told them that?</s>It's true, isn't it?</s>What the fuck's that got to do with it?</s>They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.</s>What did they say?</s>
Who's going to do it?</s>I thought we all were.</s>I don't thinkI can.</s>But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.</s>I don't want to. It's different.</s>And now you tell me.</s>
You're wastin' your time.</s>No more games.</s>

Following me to find Jacqueline?</s>Uh—huh.</s>Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.</s>Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.</s>It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.</s>
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...</s>What would you do...?</s>I like the diminished risk.

Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff.

How many to a cell?</s>Four in this block, sir.</s>Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.</s>I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.</s>Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.</s>

I'd like to hear it.</s>Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...</s>Of course.</s>
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!</s>You go too far, Benedict.</s>

Hey, girl.</s>Hey.</s>Your hair looks so cute like that.</s>
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!</s>Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.</s>
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.</s>No, he didn't.</s>What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.</s>
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.</s>What have you found out?</s>I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.</s>Where is she?</s>I don't know.</s>What do you mean?</s>Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?</s>No.</s>Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?</s>That's like a stag film.</s>Yeah.

You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?</s>No  You think she's a tweaker?</s>
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!</s>Huh huh huh.</s>
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.</s>That's worth fifteen grand to ya?</s>Maybe a couple million.</s>
Want a spike in it?</s>No thanks.</s>
They're from both of us.</s>A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?</s>
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.</s>Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.</s>
About an hour ago.</s>They're not going to find her!</s>Yes, they are.</s>

That's murder!</s>All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.</s>
For fuck's sake.</s>Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.</s>All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.</s>Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.</s>Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.</s>
Looks like he's sulking.</s>If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.</s>
What the hell you doing?!</s>His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.</s>
How did you do that?</s>The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.</s>
I don't suppose....</s>One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.</s>
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?</s>Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.</s>I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.</s>Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.</s>Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.</s>
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.</s>I just sat and listened.</s>Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.</s>

Why did you let him in?</s>What was I supposed to do?</s>
So what's the plan?</s>The plan is... you go.</s>Me?</s>My ankle. Just go explain the situation.</s>Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...</s>Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.</s>
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.</s>I say when is now -- and we will determine how.</s>
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.</s>Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.</s>Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.</s>
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.</s>No word from D'Amour?</s>
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?</s>Deodorant.</s>
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.</s>I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.</s>I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.</s>Nobody touches me.</s>Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?</s>
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.</s>You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.</s>Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?</s>
What?!</s>You're steppin' on sign.</s>
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...</s>Attempted murder.</s>
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?</s>What?  Yeah, sure.</s>Whose cloths?  Your clothes?</s>My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?</s>I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.</s>What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.</s>I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.</s>It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.</s>The coca is my responsibility!</s>You're a fucking amateur!</s>
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"</s>We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.</s>
I’m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.</s>You're a fag or a liar.</s>I mean, I am really attracted to you.</s>I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.</s>

I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.</s>...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...</s>For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...</s>
Was it him or you?</s>Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.</s>Is this a joke?</s>No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.</s>
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.</s>Likewise.</s>I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...</s>I believe you, Austin. Let's go.</s>Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.</s>
Hey, minuteman.</s>Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.</s>
How long's it been?</s>Little over two hours.</s>
Would you call this a code 100?</s>I'd double it and add 20.</s>
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.</s>So, what do you see?</s>Surprise me.</s>What usually eats a banana?</s>A monkey?</s>So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.</s>Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?</s>
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.</s>What for?</s>Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.</s>
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!</s>There's no other choice.</s>We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!</s>
Frances! Frances!</s>Who?</s>Frances, it's me, Harry?</s>...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.</s>
We're actually, finally doing this?</s>Looks like it, yeah.</s>Have you found a place to stay?</s>Yeah, downtown.</s>A hotel?</s>It's a loft.</s>Aren't you the cool guy?</s>
I appreciate you coming in so early.</s>Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.</s>Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.</s>Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.</s>
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?</s>She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.</s>That's your problem, Miles.</s>As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.</s>Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.</s>It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.</s>
You're no good at this, Jimmy.</s>I'm sorry.</s>
What's the matter with her?</s>Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?</s>
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.</s>Those sounds could be imitated.</s>I'd know the difference.</s>
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.</s>To life.</s>That's all there is.</s>Believe me I know.</s>
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.</s>I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.</s>Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.</s>
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.</s>Love, you can still write to each other.</s>
Do you understand?</s>Yes -- yes -- yes.</s>
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.</s>I think you're in anaphylactic shock --</s>No -- it's --</s>

I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.</s>Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?</s>Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...</s>
Why?!</s>I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?</s>
You were a smoker?</s>Two packs a day.</s>I can beat that.</s>Unfiltered.</s>
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.</s>Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.</s>It's beyond mere physical attraction.</s>That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.</s>Truly? Do speak.</s>My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!</s>How do you know this shit?</s>They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?</s>You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?</s>Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?</s>Good thinking Marge.</s>
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.</s>Inconceivable!</s>
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.</s>There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.</s>
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.</s>This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.</s>This could go on for hours.</s>So you're staying in tonight?</s>Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?</s>
Wave to my son.</s>How the hell do we get him down. from there?</s>Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.</s>
Thank ye.</s>Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.</s>
Don't... talk crazy.</s>Mama...?</s>They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!</s>
That means top-secret, Cooper.</s>I heard it.</s>
That's where he's going.</s>It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.</s>And destroy every planet in the system.</s>
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?</s>No. I couldn't see.</s>Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.</s>
It worked!</s>It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!</s>
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!</s>Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.</s>
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?</s>Well... actually, no Bill...</s>
Hey, you still here?</s>We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?</s>
It's shorter than our practice runway.</s>They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.</s>We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"</s>
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.</s>Well...</s>Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.</s>
O'Neil?</s>Sir?</s>You're wanted at the C.O.'s.</s>
God. How can you eat like that?</s>It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?</s>
Nicholson and I.</s>Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.</s>Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.</s>So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.</s>
Don't point it at James!</s>Voila!</s>
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!</s>Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.</s>
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.</s>But my name's not...</s>People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?</s>
They want your autograph.</s>Who am I supposed to be?</s>This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...</s>Tell them I'm not.</s>
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.</s>Where is your family?</s>
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.</s>You can't have water after morphine.</s>Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.</s>How's the pain?</s>How's yours?</s>I can handle it.</s>Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.</s>What Truth?</s>The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.</s>
Fine. I'll go straight.</s>What!</s>Fine! I'll go straight!</s>
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.</s>Yeah - lets shove off.</s>
Hon? Got the growshries.</s>Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?</s>Yah, real good.</s>Dad's here.</s>
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.</s>Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?</s>I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.</s>You found a flop!</s>A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!</s>
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.</s>Who wants me to stop?</s>
My God, you're shot...</s>Yes.</s>
He sees this differently, as you well know.</s>I didn't expect that he would.</s>You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.</s>Vincent told you that I'm a cop?</s>Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.</s>
I've tried it.</s>You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?</s>
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.</s>You must have been concerned.</s>It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?</s>Doubtful. What did he say?</s>He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.</s>
Ah - - they're here.</s>Who?</s>
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?</s>I don't know.</s>You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --</s>
Have you checked the...</s>Attic, garage, basement, nothing.</s>Take the neighborhood.</s>
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.</s>I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.</s>Listen to me, fella...</s>No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.</s>
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.</s>Possible.  So you did those wings?</s>Yeah.  A long time ago.</s>They're harder to do than they look.</s>Oh?  You've tried?</s>Well, I do a little drawing --</s>
I must be destroyed.</s>Can you get us in there, past security?</s>
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.</s>Yes, but they say he did.</s>
We was just leavin', fellows.</s>Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.</s>
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.</s>You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.</s>
You think they'll be alright?</s>They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.</s>And what about you?</s>
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.</s>What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...</s>
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.</s></s>Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --</s>Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.</s>You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.</s>Oh.</s>But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?</s>Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.</s>That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.</s>
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.</s>I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.</s>B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--</s>I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.</s>
Marlon and Al....</s>We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.</s>I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.</s>You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.</s>
For science.</s>You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.</s>
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.</s>I enjoy it.</s>The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.</s>Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.</s>
I want to ask you a few questions.</s>No, you're not model material.  Anything else?</s>
He's tough, your American friend.</s>Yes, Sam's tough alright.</s>And you respect him.</s>Of course.  Don't you?</s>I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?</s>Not exactly.</s>Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?</s>How did you know?</s>If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.</s>
What does that mean for Evan?</s>He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?</s>
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.</s>Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.</s>
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.</s>Yeah. Scary stuff.</s>
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.</s>So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.</s>It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.</s>
And I think it's because of this redhead...</s>Know who I am, Jake?</s>The Anti-Christ?</s>No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.</s>
Welcome?</s>I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.</s>
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?</s>Read the inscription on the cover!</s>
What are you going to do?</s>Don't know. Think of something.</s>
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.</s>Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.</s>You're all scumbags.</s>
Hello.</s>Hello.</s>Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...</s>...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.</s>She's not here, Sam.</s>Lester...</s>...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.</s>I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.</s>Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...</s>
How often does he get like that?</s>Whenever he's got an edge on.</s>How often is that?</s>He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.</s>
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?</s>Ten gees.</s>Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?</s>
Where did it come from?</s><u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.</s>How does he breathe?</s>
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?</s>Wasn't deemed a threat.</s>She led us right to you.  That's no threat?</s>
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.</s>Aye, sir.</s>Deanna, on my mark.</s>Ready, sir!</s>

Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.</s>It's Wood.  Ed Wood.</s>Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?</s>
Why?</s>Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.</s>Why would I want to sell my passport?</s>It was just an idea.</s>
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...</s>I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.</s>
Congratulations.  Who with?</s>A glamorous young lady way above his station...</s>

Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.</s>Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.</s>I see.</s>She's so damn... English.</s>Meaning what?</s>Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.</s>
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!</s>Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."</s>
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.</s>What is it? A tranquilizer?</s>A stimulant.</s>Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!</s>Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.</s>Depression?</s>Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.</s>Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?</s>Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.</s>And those lies she's been telling?</s>Lies?</s>Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.</s>Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?</s>Never.</s>Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-</s>Wait a minute. What are you talking about?</s>Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.</s>You're kidding! Like what?</s>Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.</s>Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!</s>
You will help me with my other problem.</s>Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.</s>
Well? Surprised?</s>What is all this? When are you coming home?</s>Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.</s>Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.</s>Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.</s>
I thought I was here to meet women.</s>Not that one!</s>I like her.</s>And don't be so obvious!</s>
Have you ever seen him?</s>How could I see him if he's invisible?</s>Good point.</s>
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...</s>Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!</s>I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...</s>Well you tried --</s>I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...</s>
You listening to me?</s>Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!</s>Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...</s>Two...</s>It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!</s>
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--</s>--But--</s>
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.</s>That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?</s>I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.</s>
And if you can't deliver them?</s><i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i></s>
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?</s>Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.</s>
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.</s>Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.</s>
What are you up to?</s>That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.</s>When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.</s>I should go to the house, get breakfast.</s>The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.</s>
Well, are you?</s>Am I what?</s>Making it with my mother?</s>
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.</s>It's a long shot.</s>
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.</s>I didn't know.</s>The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.</s>
I don't know!  Nothing!</s>If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?</s>I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!</s>
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.</s>It smells funny. Like gasoline.</s>Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.</s>My dress'll reek.</s>Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.</s>
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.</s>Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.</s>
Shit!  I... I, which way?</s>West.  Left.</s>
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?</s>Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.</s>All right, Daniel. Jump in.</s>
Duff, I love you.</s>Well, that don't do me one bit of good!</s>
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.</s>Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --</s>
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.</s>How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?</s>I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.</s>Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?</s>Yeah. And your meter just ran out.</s>
What do you do, Tyler?</s>What do you want me to do?</s>I mean -- for a living.</s>Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?</s>
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.</s>Maybe she's asleep.</s>
This girl --</s>This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.</s>I will go with you.</s>
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!</s>Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --</s>I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?</s>But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.</s>
Oh shit.</s>What's wrong?</s>Stop.</s>What for?</s>I'm spinning.</s>
I insist you get rid of that bomb.</s>Afraid I can't do that.</s>You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!</s>Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.</s>
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."</s>I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...</s>Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?</s>That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.</s>The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...</s>Such as?</s>Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...</s>
What was that?</s>What?</s>Listen.</s>
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!</s>That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.</s>Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.</s>How?</s>"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."</s>That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.</s>
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!</s>I knew you'd like him.</s>Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.</s>
Jack.</s>Your doorbell doesn't work.</s>Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.</s>
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?</s>No.</s>I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?</s>What pipes?</s>What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.</s>
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.</s>Your friend?</s>
Bastards...</s>All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.</s>He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.</s>
Are civilians inside?</s>He said something about a girl --</s>Holster your guns!</s>
She coulda killed me last night.</s>Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.</s>Who are you?</s>Gondorff asked me to look after ya.</s>How do I know you're tellin' the truth.</s>Don't have much choice, do ya?</s>
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?</s>No.</s>What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?</s>
I know where they're going.</s>Figured you did.</s>
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.</s>Design?</s>
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.</s>How do you do, sir?</s>
Oh, good...</s>...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.</s>

Not yet.  But we'll find him.</s>Dance?</s>
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?</s>No.</s>You ever going to bed?</s>No.</s>Well, I ain't sleepy either.</s>Good. Then have a drink.</s>No. Not me, boss.</s>Then don't have a drink.</s>Boss, let's get out of here.</s>No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.</s>Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.</s>She's coming back. I know she's coming back.</s>We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.</s>Shut up and go home, will you?</s>No, sir. I'm staying right here.</s>
I can't even imagine.</s>I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.</s>
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.</s>'He'...?</s>
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.</s>I don't have the problems that artists have.</s>
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?</s>Yeah, like that.</s>Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.</s>

Having a good time, Vivian?</s>Yeah.  Thanks.</s>All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.</s>
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?</s>Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.</s>
I've never seen anything like him!</s>And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --</s>Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?</s>

I hate both parties.</s>And I'm a Republican.</s>
Thank God...</s>What the fuck are you doing?</s>
Are there any questions?</s>What?</s>Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.</s>

And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.</s>But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?</s>Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.</s>Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.</s>

Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.</s>Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.</s>Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.</s>You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit.

If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.</s>The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...</s>

I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.</s>You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?</s>I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.</s>Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?</s>No. But someday.</s>Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.</s>
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.</s>Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.</s>

It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.</s>You afraid of the dark?</s>Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death.

Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?</s>Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?</s>Gee, it's easy.</s>Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment.

So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.</s>So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --</s>Theoretically.</s>-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.</s>A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.</s>So... that's it?</s>The basic principles of time travel are there.

Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.

We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.</s>
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.</s>It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.</s>

Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam</s>People have different emotional levels that --</s>Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!</s>
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important.

I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.</s>But I like teaching school.</s>Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right.

What's seventy-one?</s>A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?</s>
Did you hear what I said, son?</s>Huh?</s>Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --</s>You ain't my Dad!

Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?</s>Nah, I don't know.</s>
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...</s>I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.</s>

I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.</s>How can I help you with the particles?</s>It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate.

But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.</s>Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.</s>Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.</s>Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.</s>That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?</s>Fair enough.</s>

You come!  You speak first!</s>Tell the Chief we thank him.</s>Chief knows.</s>Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.</s>

I have to leave for Russia immediately.</s>Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!</s>Don't hold that against me... please!</s>Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?</s>Business.</s>What business?</s>Private.</s>There is no privacy in Russia.

You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?</s>You told it to me.</s>Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.

Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?</s>Yes.</s>Why, then, things should be fine.</s>A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.</s>She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years.

Try again, and this time be polite.</s>I can only tell you what he told us...</s>Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.</s>Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.</s>What sums?</s>Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels.

Made him what he was.</s>What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.</s>
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.</s>No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.</s>
Kill him.</s>It's about goddamn time.</s>

You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?</s>Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.</s>You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?</s>Because I need half a million to buy a script.</s>For a movie?</s>A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs.

Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?</s>Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?</s>Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.</s>
You ok?</s>Just thinking about something.</s>What?</s>There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.</s>I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.</s>
It smells good.</s>What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.</s>
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?</s>Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.</s>
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!

Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.</s>Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.</s>No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you.

I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.</s>Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.</s>I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?</s>Would you like me to go for her?</s>I couldn't ask you to.</s>I don't mind, really.</s>Would you?

Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.</s>Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?</s>She's haze grey and underway...</s>You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.</s>So dump on me.</s>This has nothing to do with you.</s>Well, guess I don't even need to be here...</s>Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.</s>You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.</s>Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?</s>I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --</s>Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?

Maybe we should just let it happen.</s>Which is guy-speak for...</s>Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.

And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.</s>O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.</s>
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.

But you're going to need courage, Willow.</s>I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!</s>Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.

The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...</s>Well, she was.</s>Perhaps...</s>
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.</s>Louis, I swear I did not.</s>I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.</s>
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.</s>Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.</s>I'll match any man with the sword.</s>But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.</s>Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.</s>It must have been some other gate.</s>
Yes, we'd like to get moving.</s>Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.</s>

Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.</s>

You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?</s>Sure.</s>
Smith.  Hampshire....</s>Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.</s>

And tell Merrill to swing away.</s>What?  Colleen?... Colleen?</s>
Where's Mike today?</s>Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.</s>What's April 16th?</s>It's John Bonham's birthday.</s>John Bonham?</s>John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.</s>Oh. I see.</s>
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!</s>Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.</s>
That could break the machine.</s>Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.</s>
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.</s>The gun will be there.</s>You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.</s>We gotta move...</s>
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!

What, I couldn't hear you?</s>You went out this morning and bought a gun.</s>
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.</s>Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?</s>Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing—</s>
He didn't come back here?</s>Sam.</s>No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.</s>Where could he have gone?</s>Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...</s>Without calling me?</s>In a hurry.</s>Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...</s>Yes. I think he would have.</s>
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.</s>Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?</s>Yeah.  Great.</s>I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.</s>No problem.  If I can ask one question.</s>Fine.  One.</s>It sounds stupid.</s>Nevermind.</s>You won't like it.</s>Just ask it!</s>Is it better?</s>Is what better?  Better than what?</s>Well.  Sex, I guess.

You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!</s>Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.</s>Oh that explains everything.</s>You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.</s>Big deal!</s>
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.</s>There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom!

I would never have imagined us in a place like this.</s>That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.</s>Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?</s>I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.</s>Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.</s>
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.</s>About the conspiracy?</s>I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.</s>I want to know where Scully is.</s>
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.</s>You're going to get yourself up and go out?</s>Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!</s>
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.</s>Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.</s>
What?</s>The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --</s>
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.</s>Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.</s>
I wish I could.</s>You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.</s>Can't do it.</s>I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?</s>No.</s>I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...</s>I can't do it, Shelly...</s>
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?</s>On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.</s>Wow!</s>
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...</s>Good.</s>Good.</s>
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.</s>It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --</s>Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.</s>It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --</s>
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.</s>But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!</s>Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?</s>
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!</s>The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.</s>
Why do you want a room here?</s>Do you smoke?</s>
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...</s>Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.</s>
Melanie, Melanie...</s>I'm frightened, Mitch.</s>No, no...</s>I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...</s>Melanie...</s>...everything I know.</s>
Not bad for a gimp.</s>What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.</s>
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?</s>Yes, desperately.</s>Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.</s>Better than I...</s>That's the spirit!</s>
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"</s>0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?</s>Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.</s>Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?</s>
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?</s>She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?</s>
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.</s>Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.</s>
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.</s>Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!</s>

The kid's sorry, Auggie.</s>Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.</s>He's got something to tell you, Auggie.</s>If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?</s>
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.</s>Where is it?</s>I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.</s>That was a big mistake.</s>
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.</s>Yeah, how so?</s>I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.</s>There's to be a bright side, look for it.</s>Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.</s>There's always a bright side.</s>I'm listening, sir.</s>Well, I, for one, like cheese.</s>
He's a good pilot.</s>I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.</s>
Give me your hand.</s>Oh, my God...</s>
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.</s>You're hearing about somebody else.</s>How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?</s>When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.</s>Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.</s>I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?</s>You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.</s>You don't know how wrong you are.</s>
Hi.</s>Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.</s>Why?</s>Just look at them!</s>
It'll be over soon.</s>No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.</s>There'll be time for that.</s>
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?</s>Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.</s>
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?</s>Listen to Andy, Sean.</s>We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?</s>
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.</s>Do you?</s>All I need is time.</s>I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.</s>
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?</s>When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.</s>So you saved her.</s>Yeah.  But not for long.</s>
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.</s>Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.</s>
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.</s>That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?</s>Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?</s>
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.</s>This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.</s>
Yeah... fine.</s>Give me five minutes.</s>
Me like-y.</s>Stay right. Left is trouble.</s>I though we went over this.</s>Last one down springs for room service.</s>
How's that?</s>Oh, I could die...</s>Over this?</s>Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!</s>You are one scary son-of-a-gun.</s>
How could you be a part of this?</s>These are my people now. I'm one of them.</s>You don't have to be.</s>You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.</s>
So, what do we do now?</s>That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.</s>
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.</s>Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.</s>
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.</s>What do you want with us?</s>Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.</s>
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...</s>Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.</s>Well, I certainly would have heard about that.</s>Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.</s>...I don't think I know that hospital.</s>It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...</s>Really? You've just described all of Southern California.</s>
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.</s>Look at that.</s>
Getting nervous?</s>Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.</s>
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?</s>You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...</s>
If you were in love with me, would you?</s>I'm not in love with you.</s>But if you were?</s>I... I can't answer that precisely.</s>But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.</s>That's very flattering.</s>So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?</s>Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?</s>I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?</s>
You've got no choice.</s>Whata you mean I've got no choice?</s>Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...</s>For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.</s>No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.

Yes, sir.</s>You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .</s>
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.</s>It's not about working hard --</s>Bullshit.</s>-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.</s>-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.</s>
What do you read?</s>Twenty eight.</s>
A lot?</s>Enough.</s>
It was snowing.</s>There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.</s>
Mmmm... you smell good.</s>You don't.</s>It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.</s>
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?</s>We're crossing the threshold!</s>
George?  What do you know about cocaine?</s>I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.</s>No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.</s>
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.</s>You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!</s>
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.</s>OK, see you downstairs.</s>

How's that? Can you hear me better now?</s>Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?</s>Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.</s>Yes, Sir!</s>Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.</s>Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.</s>I'm not at the hotel!</s>
See you in the fleet, sir!</s>Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.</s>
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.</s>Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.</s>
It's kind of dark -</s>Shh!</s>
You're sure this is gonna work?</s>Yes!</s>You're <u>sure</u>???</s>YES!  JUST DO IT!</s>
Yeah, its really different here.</s>Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?</s>It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.</s>Ok, well... I love you.</s>I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .</s>Good-night.</s>
Where did you get that alcohol?</s>I packed it. Just for us.</s>
So really, it's good luck.</s>Good luck?</s>Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.</s>
Shit...</s>Check your read-out.</s>
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.</s>They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.</s>I knew there was a sound explanation.</s>
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.</s>I understand.</s>May I ask you something?</s>
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?</s>I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.</s>
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?</s>Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.</s>
You're limping.</s>I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.</s>Are you okay?  You want some help?</s>NO.</s>You are leaving, aren't you?</s>
Panther...</s>Panther!  Same thing...</s>Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.</s>Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.</s>Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.</s>
Hey, Diz...</s>What ?</s>
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.</s>It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.</s>
What?</s>And you think I'm sick?</s>
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.</s>A third party?</s>Yes. The John Doe Party.</s>
Have you seen Willie?</s>Is he not back yet?</s>Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.</s>It's far too late for him to still be out.</s>
So far, so good. Now what?</s>Put it in your mouth.</s>
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.</s>Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.</s>There were six of us...</s>
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --</s>-- Hello, Ilsa.</s>
I am the dark master!</s>Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!</s>SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!</s>Oh.</s>YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!</s>
You wouldn't even see it move.</s>You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.</s>
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.</s>I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.</s>
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?</s>I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.</s>It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.</s>
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.</s>My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?</s>
Mom?</s>Yes?</s>Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?</s>Not right now, Daddy's asleep.</s>I won't make any noise.</s>Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?</s>I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.</s>
And I might have something important to tell you...</s>What is it, a surprise?</s>That's right...</s>
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?</s>Nah...</s>Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.</s>
Well, you're a widower now...</s>What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..</s>
He's not part of the program.</s>Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.</s>
...So?</s>I think someone's watching.</s>
Mr. Stevens?</s>I've been dreading you.</s>
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?</s>This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.</s>Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?</s>
Wear this.</s>You're a real buddy.</s>Yeah, I know.</s>What do I do?</s>Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!</s>
What the hell are you doing?</s>Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?</s>Your old sweetheart?</s>Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?</s>I left my forgery kit back at the office.</s>
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...</s>If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!</s>Would they?</s>
Jesus, Jim!</s>Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.</s>Just be careful.</s>You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?</s>Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.</s>Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?</s>
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!</s>Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--</s>
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...</s>Such as?</s>You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.</s>
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.</s>Some example you set.</s>
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?</s>I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.</s>
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.</s>That lucky bastard.</s>What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?</s>
No, not her. Me.</s>Who's you?</s>
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.</s>A key party?</s>You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.</s>
Isn't he schizoid?</s>Hey!  How 'bout that!</s>
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!</s>The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.</s>
You ready?</s>All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--</s>
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?</s>No way!</s>Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?</s>Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.</s>Is  something going to happen Saturday night?</s>
How old were you?</s>I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."</s>You've done nothing but study swordplay?</s>More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.</s>Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.</s>You are ready, then?</s>Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.</s>

My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...</s>Well...I know there were some captives recovered...</s>
They're not looking for him.</s>Why not?</s>
So that was why she tried to run away.</s>Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?</s>I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.</s>Hold on.</s>We can't stay here!</s>It's a long walk back to Aspen.</s>
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --</s>60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".</s>It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.</s>
Metaxonycha Godmani.</s>So?</s>
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.</s>I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.</s>Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!</s>I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.</s>Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!</s>
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?</s>Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.</s>
I don't think we should meet again.</s>It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.</s>
Why Memphis?</s>Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???</s>
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.</s>I know, Terrance. I know.</s>
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?</s>Yeah.  I follow you.</s>We've lost enough agents for one night.</s>You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.</s>
Hey!!</s>You threw it at me!!</s>I just let go of it.</s>
See them, Elaine?</s>Uh-huh.</s>
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...</s>...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?</s>...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...</s>Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...</s>
You feel anything?</s>Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...</s>Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...</s>Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?</s>I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.</s>
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.</s>We own a small family grocery store.</s>
What about that ugly dog?</s>I got my mase.</s>
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?</s>Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.</s>
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?</s>No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.</s>Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.</s>Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.</s>I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.</s>Enough!</s>
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!</s>colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—</s>You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.</s>You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.</s>
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.</s>Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.</s>
You like Michael.</s>I like Michael.</s>You better not like him too much.</s>
So, where are we going?</s>Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.</s>
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?</s>I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.</s>What about Don?</s>Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.</s>
Mrs. Rand...</s>You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.</s>Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.</s>
Thanks for the ride.</s>They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.</s>None taken.</s>Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.</s>You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?</s>The Academy, then CIIAC.</s>I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.</s>How long have you been downtown?</s>Five months. I love it.</s>
How the hell did you do that?</s>Magic.</s>
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...</s>I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.</s>
What the hell was that, another statement?</s>Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.</s>You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...</s>
Neither will I.</s>I think I'm ready for the Show.</s>Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.</s>Don't worry.</s>
That's disgusting.</s>Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.</s>
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.</s>Good. That's good.</s>
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?</s>Oh, sure.</s>
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.</s>Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.</s>Who's shooting?</s>
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.</s>How about Ding Dong?</s>He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.</s>
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.</s>Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!</s>Home is important to a man.</s>You know what gets me?</s>No.</s>How all the magazines show tits today.</s>Um.</s>Used to be against the law, didn't it?</s>I suppose.</s>Must have changed that law.</s>
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...</s>Tonight!  How's tonight?</s>
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...</s>So what are you saying?</s>I don't know what I'm saying.</s>
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."</s>Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.</s>
How'd you do?</s>Piece of cake. She'll be there.</s>Thanks, butt wart. You did good.</s>So you gonna try and make up with Sid?</s>Duh... that's quick.</s>I was just asking. Why are you always at me?</s>Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.</s>Oh...</s>
You all right now?</s>Yeah.</s>You coming to South America?</s>No.</s>
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.</s>I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.</s>Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".</s>Some what?</s>You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.</s>Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.</s>Sure I do. On one condition.</s>You can't marry my mom.</s>It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.</s>Shut up!</s>Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.</s>
Nice to meet you, Fergus.</s>My pleasure, Jody</s>
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.</s>Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.</s>Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.</s>
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?</s>All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.</s>
Rip Van Winkle.</s>How ya feeling?</s>How do I look?</s>Not too good.</s>
You'll be sorry?</s>I was angry.</s>You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?</s>No -- she asked me about cocaine.</s>I suggest it never happened.</s>
Come on in.</s>I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.</s>
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?</s>Yes.</s>That's your full name?</s>Yes.</s>I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?</s>Yes.</s>You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.</s>I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.</s>Eventually rising to...</s>Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.</s>
My mother said it would be all right.</s>She didn't say anything about it to me.</s>Well, she's my mother, not yours.</s>I won't be held responsible.</s>How long will she he away?</s>There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.</s>
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?</s>Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.</s>
Well, you did break out --</s>I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.</s>It is. You got yourself on TV again.</s>"Myers", huh? You have a first name??</s>Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.</s>
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.</s>Easy.</s>
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.</s></s>With or without the rest of the fleet?</s>A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.</s>New Praetor?</s>There's more... as always. He's Reman.</s>
Al?</s>The little man in my...  ...head...</s>
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.</s>If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me</s>
You okay?</s>I'm okay. Go back to your friends.</s>
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.</s>The cops and company raise hell they find out.</s>
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...</s>I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.</s>... We must try to communicate with them.</s>
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...</s>Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.</s>
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!</s>Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!</s>
Go on.</s>Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.</s>Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...</s>
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.</s>I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!</s>Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.</s>So you can't tell me anything?</s>It's going to be a long winter.</s>
Then you must be at least 70 years old.</s>At least.</s>That's impossible.</s>
Does Cole know about this?</s>Really -- you went with him for two years.</s>
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.</s>How long had that been going on?</s>A couple of weeks, I think.</s>
Can I help you?</s>Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...</s>Does she know you're coming?</s>No, no.  She doesn't.</s>I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.</s>Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...</s>... can't let you through.</s>
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...</s>What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?</s>How was your flight?</s>We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...</s>Did you bring Bob's weights?</s>They're coming Fedex...</s>What's in all the bags?</s>My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.</s>I'm gonna' bring it off.</s>55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...</s>
Sylvia Plath.</s>M'hm...</s>Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.</s>Oh, yeah.</s>Oh, sorry.</s>Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.</s>Neat?</s>Neat, yeah.</s>Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?</s>Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.</s>Duane?</s>Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.</s>Well, who's Sadie?</s>Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...</s>Uh, narcolepsy.</s>Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.</s>
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?</s>Thought you was followin' me.</s>
Morning!  Who's that little old man?</s>It's Paul's grandfather.</s>Oh aye, but I thought ...</s>
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?</s>He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.</s>Captain, what do you want?</s>Call me Dudley.</s>Dudley, what do you want?</s>Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?</s>Yeah, I hate them.</s>And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.</s>
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?</s>I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.</s>
You see? You have someone to live for.</s>No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.</s>What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.</s>You don't even know me. I want real respect.</s>
You should have someone look after you.</s>I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.</s>
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?</s>I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.</s>We can look into that.</s>I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.</s>You know what we want.</s>If I'm working, I can help you.</s>
I don't know...</s>It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?</s>

It was a honest mistake, sir.</s>I presume the planes are armed?</s>I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.</s>Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?</s>That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.</s>And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?</s>Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?</s>What the hell is Plan-R?</s>Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.</s>Why can't you cancel it?</s>Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.</s>And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.</s>Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.</s>

Then it's not an accident that they found us.</s>We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.</s>Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?</s>We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.</s>That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.</s>We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.</s>Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.</s>You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.</s>

I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.</s>
What is it you find incredible?</s>Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.</s>No, they don't.</s>Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.</s>

Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.</s>We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.</s>We think we've got our finger on the buyer.</s>Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.</s>Yes, I believe that's right.</s>But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.</s>You mean that leaves Miss Hall.</s>Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.</s>

Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run.

I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...</s>I don't understand.</s>I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.</s>Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.</s>What?</s>As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.</s>
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.</s>They always paid.</s>
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?</s>Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.</s>
But I ain't got you...</s>But I ain't got you...</s>No, I ain't got you...</s>No, I ain't got you...</s>I said, I ain't got you...</s>I said, I ain't got you...</s>I ain't -- got -- you.</s>
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.</s>Is that Donald Trump's car?</s>Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.</s>You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.</s>I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...</s>
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!</s>You know exactly where they are!</s>
You saw him?</s>A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...</s>
She's cute as a button.</s>How long have they been married?</s>
This is Bandit I. Over.</s>Where the hell are you?</s>Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...</s>
Dad!</s>Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.</s>
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -</s>You won't be lonely, Charles...</s>
Don't give me that look.</s>What look?</s>You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.</s>We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.</s>I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.</s>
Milo?</s>My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.</s>My goodness.</s>It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?</s>If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.</s>I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.</s>Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.</s>'Just didn't know who else to talk to.</s>And Outpost? You're happy there?</s>Yes sir.</s>
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.</s>What did he want?</s>He asked how you are.</s>And you said?</s>I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.</s>I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.</s>You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...</s>We have it good, don't we?</s>All the things that happened to you before make you know that...</s>
It's over, J.D.  Over!</s>I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!</s>
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.</s>I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?</s>What?</s>Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!</s>
I'm ready now.</s>Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.</s>
What's the title?</s>Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.</s>Good title.</s>
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.</s>What ship?</s>
I feel very good in here.</s>Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.</s>Yes. I like that very much.</s>
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.</s>I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.</s>
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --</s>Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --</s>As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.</s>
Yeah, buddy?</s>Can you borrow me a dime?</s>Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...</s>
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?</s>I know her. I knew her.</s>
I don't know.</s>Are we gonna split up?</s>No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?</s>
Did he hear you?</s>You're breaking up. I can't hear you.</s>
You're hurt.</s>Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.</s>
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?</s>The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.</s>
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.</s>I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.</s>
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!</s>I was just straightening up the place.</s>Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?</s>I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.</s>
In what, a romantic comedy?</s>Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.</s>
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.</s>Hope you find him. I love that dog.</s>
I think I better go, Stew.</s>I think you should, Miss Gallagher.</s>
Well, all right, then.</s>Well, all reet, then.</s>
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?</s>I don't fool around with you.</s>
What the hell are they doing?</s>They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.</s>
You know somethin', Daddy?</s>What's that, son?</s>I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.</s>
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.</s>Evelyn, put her to bed.</s>
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake</s>None of that's true?</s>Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.</s>So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?</s>My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.</s>
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.</s>Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...</s>
Women will want to get to know you...</s>I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!</s>
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?</s>Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.</s>Find me something, I don't care where it is.</s>Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...</s>Fuck that shit.</s>Well, it is kind of a long shot...</s>It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?</s>Well, there's the possibility of...</s>Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?</s>All right, then...</s>So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.</s>
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...</s>What is it?</s>It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.</s>But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?</s>Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.</s>
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.</s>You didn't have to do this.</s>Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.</s>Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.</s>
What's up?</s>Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.</s>
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...</s>Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?</s>We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...</s>See that it is.  Take me over, please.</s>
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...</s>I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...</s>
It was fine.</s>I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.</s>I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.</s>Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.</s>
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.</s>Don't get too cocky.</s>Why not?</s>You can make a mistake.</s>Not me.</s>
See, Frank's being smart about this.</s>Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.</s>
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?</s>The Windmill.</s>
You might have mentioned me first.</s>He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.</s>As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --</s>
Are you alright?</s>What?  What's wrong?  What is it?</s>
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.</s>Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...</s>That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.</s>She's right.</s>
Are you in charge here?</s>No, sir...</s>I asked for the man in charge...</s>That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...</s>Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...</s>Is she injured?</s>
At least you and Kendall agree on that.</s>What happened next?</s>
I hope it's the right kind.</s>Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!</s>
Where's she work?</s>What?</s>Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?</s>J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.</s>What's her middle name?</s>Samantha.</s>What'd they call her in high school?</s>Bam Bam.</s>What'd they call her in college?</s>What college.</s>Where'd she drop her cherry?</s>
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.</s>Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.</s>
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.</s>The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.</s>
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?</s>Yeah.</s>How did Kittridge do it?..</s>
I thought she was a widow.</s>You were wrong, you quack!</s>
How long?</s>A matter of hours now.</s>
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.</s>Yeah?</s>I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.</s>You're kidding.</s>Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.</s>What?</s>'Incurable.'</s>
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!</s>Everyone needs something.</s>
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...</s>Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.</s>Yes, sir.</s>Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.</s>
Oh, there you are!</s>Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.</s>You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.</s>Is he?</s>Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.</s>
May I help you?</s>Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.</s>Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.</s>
Captain...?</s>We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.</s>
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--</s>Yes.</s>Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?</s>Yes -- of course.</s>Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.</s>That can easily be arranged.</s>I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.</s>Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.</s>Maybe a little demonstration.</s>Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?</s>
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?</s>Yes...</s>Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?</s>Let's get naked.</s>You're on.</s>
Need something else?</s>No, I was just... How you doing?</s>Great. Good. Content...</s>Oh. How come?</s>I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?</s>They're fine... you miss it?</s>You must be joking.</s>Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?</s>Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...</s>'Kay, good. Bye, then...</s>Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.</s>
Is it bad?</s>No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?</s>I didn't.</s>Some kinds of women are...</s>
I need help.</s>He'll be back before curfew.</s>I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.</s>He'll be here soon.</s>
What happened?</s>Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.</s>
Did you meet the President?</s>Honey, your father knows the President.</s>
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.</s>A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?</s>That’s right. And auto supply...</s>Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.</s>
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.</s>I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.</s>What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --</s>I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.</s>Raoul is everything to me.</s>I know.</s>Oh my friend.</s>
No -- you can't do that.</s>You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.</s>I don't know.</s>He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.</s>Not that we know of.</s>We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.</s>Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.</s>
Lugosi?</s>Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!</s>Isn't he dead?</s>No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.</s>OUR picture?</s>Uh, yeah.  Our picture.</s>
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.</s>You know the other day, you asked why I came back?</s>Yeah?</s>I came back 'cause you were here.</s>
I thought I'd go along for the ride.</s>Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?</s>I thought maybe you'd like some company.</s>
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.</s>Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.</s>
I knew him.</s>Soon he'll be a plastic cube.</s>Shut up.</s>
Uh, home, you know.</s>Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.</s>You didn't get me in trouble.</s>
Where's my wife?</s>With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.</s>
Are you all set?</s>Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.</s>I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.</s>
Find anything interesting?</s>Why do I feel like the other man, here?</s>Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.</s>I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.</s>What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?</s>
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?</s>I feel good.</s>No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?</s>Nope.</s>
...Screw you.</s>What'd you say?</s>...Screw you, yoyo.</s>
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.</s>You quitter you quitter you quitter.</s>The sea is lovely, dark and deep.</s>But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.</s>Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.</s>If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.</s>Die tomorrow or die today.</s>
Where'd you get this?</s>I found it outside.</s>
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!</s>Willie!</s>
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.</s>This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?</s>I been sick. Hold this, will ya?</s>
Does this offer include my partner?</s>Only if he can be trusted.</s>He'll do what I say.</s>
What's happening?</s>We're leaving.</s>Where's my father?</s>
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --</s>As I said, we can pay you in gold.</s>Entirely unnecessary, Captain.</s>
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.</s>Gary.</s>When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.</s>Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.</s>My condolences.</s>What are you pouring tonight?</s>Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?</s>Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.</s>
And?</s>And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.</s>The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --</s>-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?</s>
What is that?</s>Braces.</s>Braces?</s>Yes.</s>You don't need braces.</s>Yes I do.</s>Your teeth are fine.</s>
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?</s>...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...</s>...who <u>are</u> you?  Who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches...</s>
Oh...</s>M-E...</s>
What are you doing up?</s>I was thirsty.</s>There's a bathroom upstairs.</s>The water tastes better in the kitchen.</s>That's true.  Why is that?</s>
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.</s>Can we switch?</s>What, switch what?</s>I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --</s>
You don't know how pleased he'll be.</s>What!</s>
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?</s>Possible.  But not darn likely.</s>
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?</s>Memory lane.</s>
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.</s>Great.</s>Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.</s>Oh, that Karl.</s>Yes, Jon.  That Karl.</s>I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...</s>
This looks like new grass to you?</s>It looks pretty green for this climate.</s>
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?</s>Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.</s>I dunno, boy.</s>You don't know?</s>It was a bitch.</s>Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.</s>
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.</s>You can be a thief and have a conscience.</s>No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?</s>I don't.</s>Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?</s>Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.</s>And that's the only reason?</s>Can you think of a better one?</s>Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.</s>Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?</s>Much.</s>Then feel better!..</s>
This is a sexy case.</s>Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.</s>Doesn't fit.</s>This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.</s>And who kills in the manner of his victim.</s>That information's being withheld from the media.</s>A very sexy case.</s>
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?</s>They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.</s>So what made you think it was?</s>It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.</s>What medical records?</s>The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?</s>I didn't see any medical records in there.</s>Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.</s>
Do you hear me?</s>He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.</s>
...they say you're alright.</s>I'm fine.</s>This is it, then.</s>What?</s>The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?</s>He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.</s>That's not what I hear.</s>I was flying...my responsibility.</s>That's what you get flight pay for.</s>Maybe I shouldn't take it.</s>Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.</s>Not to me.</s>You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.</s>
Leave that.</s>Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?</s>
This is a restricted area.</s>Check him out, Ray.</s>
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.</s>Did he see any sign of them?</s>
Hey, Mark. Is that you?</s>Damone! You come here?</s>I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?</s>Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.</s>
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.</s>Okay.</s>We might as well pack.</s>Good idea.</s>
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...</s>It's okay.</s>Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?</s>It's the sequel.</s>Oh, right.</s>Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.</s>I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.</s>
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.</s>I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.</s>
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?</s>This way's perfect.</s>
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?</s>Yeah, let's check out the low-life.</s>
So how are you really doing, Panes?</s>Why don't you go fuck yourself?</s>No.  Really.  For real.  Really.</s>I'm worried about your Galiano.</s>You're a shit.</s>No, really, five thousand with your discount.</s>
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..</s>Grateful for your candor, Sir.</s>Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..</s>Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?</s>Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..</s>
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.</s>I'd like that.</s>
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.</s>Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.</s>
Well, not exactly.</s>You been with a girl ever?</s>Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?</s>I think so.</s>You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?</s>I swear.</s>Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither.

Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?</s>Yes?</s>Virginia or Elizabeth?</s>Virginia.</s>Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?</s>That sounds fun.</s>I need some information from you then.  How old are you?</s>Six.</s>And how tall are you?</s>
Not since we were kids.</s>I've stopped a hundred times.</s>So how's Tommy?</s>They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.</s>

Fuck you.</s>Guess who?</s>When...</s>
Dad--?</s>"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"</s>
So long.</s>Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.</s>
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?</s>Maybe because you're looking her in the face.</s>
Howard Stern.</s>Obviously.</s>
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?</s>O.K.</s>
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!</s>Got lost in his own museum, huh?</s>
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.</s>What is he being charged with?</s>I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.</s>Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.</s>That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.</s>
Pouring myself into my work.</s>I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.</s>Oh.  "Kyle."</s>

There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.</s>Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.</s>

No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.</s>He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.</s>
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.</s>What do I get?</s>You get half mine and I get half yours.</s>I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.</s>Then we've gotta start one.

Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.</s>I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.</s>Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.</s>
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--</s>What about everything since?</s>
I can't move.</s>Just relax.</s>What's happening? Help me.</s>

What do you think it is?</s>I have no idea.</s>
How can you not like the Top 10 List?</s>I like it.     But Headlines are better.</s>You're so wrong.</s>
Jim, itís over.</s>Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.</s>
Did you know him very well?</s>You get to know each other pretty well out there.</s>And you admired him?</s>He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --</s>Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.</s>You knew him best.</s>You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...

He died as he lived...</s>His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.</s>Were you with him, when...</s>Yes I was... He said his last words to me.</s>
I'm Melanie.</s>You're late for breakfast.</s>
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?</s>Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.</s>
Why would he go to Odessa?</s>To kill your wife.</s>
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.</s>Mr. Nixon.</s>
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--</s>That's in Maverick County.</s>
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."</s>She intends to change the future somehow.</s>I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!</s>Dyson.</s>Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!</s>

Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.</s>Any exceptions?</s>25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.</s>Give me 365.</s>
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?</s>Well, it's kind of weird.</s>We don't judge here.</s>OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.</s>And how do you feel about that?</s>I don't wanna take over the family business.</s>
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?</s>No question of her loyalty.</s>
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?</s>George . . .</s>
You have?</s>Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?</s>
You eat like a bird.</s>You'd know, of course.</s>Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...</s>
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?</s>Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.</s>
You ok?</s>I'm fine.</s>[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...</s>Then don't.</s>But... what about Starks?</s>What about Starks?</s>Should we be...</s>Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.</s>But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?</s>
Come in.</s>Hello.</s>
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.</s>Med-kit?</s>I guessed.</s>
I do. I'm not allowing it.</s>But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?</s>
The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?</s>...they... <u>you</u> know...</s>

...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?</s>That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.</s>Can you hang on a second?</s>
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.</s>Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!</s>
And me? ...</s>Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.</s>And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.</s>Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.</s>It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.</s>What?</s>Mr. Castro.</s>Yes.</s>We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.</s>Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.</s>I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.</s>
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.</s>People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.</s>
You know each other?</s>We met here earlier this evening.</s>How neat.  How keen.</s>
Yes?</s>And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?</s>
You heard me.</s>Are you serious?</s>Yeah... I think so.</s>
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.</s>How the hell did he get away?</s>Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.</s>

I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.</s>Wladek, please.</s>No one plays Chopin like you.</s>
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?</s>It couldn't possibly interest you.</s>
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?</s>Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?</s>Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?</s>Nah, she asked the wrong question.</s>What was that?</s>"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.</s>So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?</s>Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.</s>Okay.</s>What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?</s>Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?</s>Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.</s>Yeah, right...</s>Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.</s>...and if I did, what's in it for moi?</s>
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.</s>Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.</s>
I believe I have found a faster way.</s>Hmmm?</s>Uh-uh.</s>
He'll freeze.</s>Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.</s>
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.</s>Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.</s>Really?!  Well good for you.</s>I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.</s>Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.</s>Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.</s>I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?</s>
What were the yards like?</s>Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?</s>Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.</s>That's interesting.</s>It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.</s>Yes. I'd considered it.</s>You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?</s>I want your opinion.</s>I don't have one right now.</s>When you do have one I'd like to hear it.</s>May I keep the file?</s>I haven't decided yet.</s>I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?</s>
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.</s>Yeah? What happened?</s>Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.</s>...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.</s>Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.</s>
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?</s>If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.</s>No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.</s>
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.</s>I should show them an American?</s>
He's out by the pool right now.</s>Right now?</s>Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.</s>
You think?</s>Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.</s>
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?</s>I don't think so.</s>Are you going to leave me too?</s>Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.</s>Are you sent by God?</s>
What if they do question the authenticity?</s>Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.</s>I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.</s>Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.</s>
An atomic bomb.</s>Professor, be serious, would you?</s>I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.</s>You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!</s>You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.</s>
She looks tired.</s>She's stunted, that's one thing.</s>
You okay?</s>It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.</s>You made a mistake.</s>
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.</s>What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?</s>
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.</s>Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.</s>I'm sorry.</s>Yes...</s>Can you make it back?</s>Oh my... I'll try.</s>
How do you know that?</s>I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.</s>
I counted to three, honey.</s>Well sure, honey, but...</s>
Good to see you, son.</s>It's good to see you, Dad.</s>
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.</s>How about rapacious and love- starved?</s>No.</s>It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --</s>It is not --</s>Right, right.</s>

You don't have time.  Not a chance.</s>I'll be right down.  It's right tight.</s>
No, thank you. I'll be all right.</s>Look, this is my house. I'd like to—</s>Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.</s>What happened?</s>Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.</s>

Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?</s>Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.</s>
Where would you most like to be now, man?</s>Doesn't matter where.</s>Come on, man. If this shit was all over.</s>Having a pint in the Rock.</s>You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.</s>Like what?</s>Like having a pint in the Metro --</s>
Why do you think?  About my staying?</s>Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…</s>Oh.</s>But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?</s>
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.</s>I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.</s>They are the same.</s>Do you live in a house back in wherever.</s>Grand Rapids? Of course.</s>On your own land?</s>
Hey, there - open up!</s>Come on out!  We're friends!</s>
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.</s>That's the rock star thing.</s>No, no.</s>Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!</s>Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.</s>Sorry.</s>Jesus Christ.</s>You wanna bet he's with a girl?</s>No, he's not with a girl.</s>Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!</s>You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.</s>Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?</s>I'd get bored.</s>I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.</s>That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?</s>Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.</s>That sounds so depressing.</s>Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!</s>No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.</s>Ah!</s>I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.</s>Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.</s>Watch out for that tree.</s>

I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!</s>It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!</s>Yes, and he has a choice!</s>
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.</s>That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.</s>Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?</s>Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.</s>Do you tell lies?</s>
Is it good?</s>I don't know. It might be...</s>
Your father asked you a question.</s>What? -- I...</s>

Mrs. Bledsoe?</s>That's me.</s>I'm Sheriff Deeds--</s>Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.</s>Yeah, that's the story of my life.</s>You ever play one of these?</s>I've seen 'em.</s>Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.</s>You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?</s>I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.</s>He had the club out on the old trail road--</s>We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.</s>So you must remember Sheriff Wade.</s>Not if I can help it.</s>You had to deal with him in running the club.</s>Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.</s>He squeezed money out of you?</s>Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.</s>And my father?</s>Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.</s>People didn't complain?</s>Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.</s>Do you remember the last time you saw him?</s>
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?</s>Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.</s>You mean Tattaglia.</s>Barzini.</s>He was the one behind Sollozzo?</s>Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.</s>

Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.</s>What?</s>This sucks.</s>Yeah, heh heh.</s>
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.</s>How many men?</s>One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"</s>

Very nice.</s>I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.</s>
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.</s>He does landscapes.</s>
Not any more.</s>Why are they under there?</s>Mom doesn't like me to have them.</s>
How old are you?</s>Seventeen.</s>
What?</s>They fired me.</s>
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.</s>Do you love her?</s>A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!</s>I asked you a question. Do you love her?</s>Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.</s>
Diane, how are you feeling?</s>Fine.</s>
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.</s>I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...</s>
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.</s>Who's Mr. Henry?</s>You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.</s>
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.</s>Something happened to him?</s>
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.</s>Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!</s>What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.</s>

I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.</s>We should leave too.</s>There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.</s>
Thanks for your help, Peck.</s>Are you okay?</s>As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!</s>I don't know.</s>
Do you think we can turn it on?</s>I don't know.</s>
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.</s>Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.</s>Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?</s>If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential.

Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.</s>Oh, you got a problem with that?</s>
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!</s>Over... my... dead... body!</s>

Why did you come here tonight, Linda?</s>People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.</s>I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.</s>This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.</s>Where did you here that?</s>Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.</s>
I haven't been there for three years.</s>I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?</s>No, they're living in Nice now.</s>That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?</s>Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.</s>You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?</s>Ah-hh, no.</s>I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.</s>
You cold, James?</s>A little.</s>So what are you doing out here?</s>It's colder in there.</s>You're right.</s>
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.</s>Thanks.  Nice meeting you.</s>
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.</s>We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options?

Get your hands off my daughter!</s>Your what?</s>
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.</s>Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.</s>What are you talking about?  It's over.</s>Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.</s>You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?</s>I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.</s>The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.</s>Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.</s>
No, don't go away!</s>Only this far.</s>
You cashed the check?</s>Not to my knowledge, no...</s>
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.</s>I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.</s>Good. That's good.</s>
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...</s>Leaving...</s>
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.</s>How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.</s>You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?</s>With what motive?</s>Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.</s>He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.</s>
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.</s>Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?</s>
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.</s>But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?</s>

Were you happy at school, Harold?</s>Yes.</s>You liked your teachers?</s>Yes.</s>Your classmates?</s>Yes.</s>Your studies?</s>Yes.</s>Then why did you leave?</s>I burnt down the Chemistry building.</s>
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?</s>Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....</s>
You... you are alive.</s>Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?</s>
And none of them worked?</s>No.</s>
Get away from me.</s>Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?</s>Shut up.</s>

Interesting. You got a card?</s>
What are you doing?</s>I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile.</s>

But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?</s>Not me.</s>
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?</s>We won.</s>Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?</s>It satisfied me.</s>
Nice view, huh?</s>Breathtaking.</s>
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.</s>This is totally irrelevant.</s>Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.</s>Can we just get back to Kobayashi?</s>The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.</s>
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.</s>Yeah, me too, okay, cool.</s>
You didn't see this.  Understand?</s>Yes.</s>

You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?</s>No. Don't bother.</s>
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.</s>I have no extraordinary powers.</s>Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?</s>In the old books. It's called a glaive.</s>
You want to see my friends?</s>Sorry, don't have the time.</s>No problem.</s>
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.</s>Yes, there is.</s>
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....</s>Feathers all over the place....</s>It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.</s>
She got it.  Turned it down.</s>I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...</s>
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!</s>He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.</s>A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!</s>You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.</s>Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.</s>
And what did she die of, exactly?</s>She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.</s>Oh, sure!</s>
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?</s>No...</s>He said he traveled for two months.</s>I took a different route.</s>

They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.</s>Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.</s>
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.</s>I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!</s>Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?</s>I'm staying pregnant, Le.</s>Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.</s>What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.</s>But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.</s>I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.</s>Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.</s>Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.</s>
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?</s>Because he called me.</s>
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.</s>I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...</s>You're being paranoid.</s>It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...</s>
All it takes is one second?</s>Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.</s>I'm gonna start rolling --</s>-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?</s>Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --</s>
Could we hear to China?</s>On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.</s>Could we hear to the moon?</s>Big enough radio, I don't see why not.</s>Could we hear God?</s>Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.</s>Okay, okay... there.</s>

Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?</s>Yes.</s>My Doctor Lady?</s>Mine, too.</s>
Slower! In... Out...</s>Sorry!</s>

Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.</s>You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.</s>
I don't know.</s>If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.</s>
You--  Standards and Practices?</s>Ed Smythe, yes.</s>Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?</s>
Good day...!</s>I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.</s>Oh, no.</s>I knew you'd understand. Here.</s>
I have to talk to you. It's very important.</s>I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.</s>It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?</s>All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.</s>

I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.</s>What do you want?</s>You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.</s>I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.</s>I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?</s>Fight what?</s>When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!</s>
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on.

I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?</s>No.</s>This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?</s>I deny his every charge.</s>Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?</s>That is a complete falsehood.</s>Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?</s>That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.</s>
Data!</s>Sorry, sir.</s>
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.</s>How many weeks are you honey/</s>Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"</s>You need his blood-type.  Like right away.</s>Well I know he's come here before.</s>What's his name?</s>Peter...Peter Kelson.</s>You just call?</s>I didn't know what else to do...</s>
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.</s>Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.</s>
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?</s>She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.</s>Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.</s>

The dreams again, sir?</s>I think they're getting worse.</s>It's a wonder you sleep at all.</s>
Good afternoon.</s>I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.</s>Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.</s>Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?</s>You're right.  You're fired.</s>Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.</s>The Italian, I presume?</s>No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.</s>He seems to have won it.</s>Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!</s>
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!</s>Elora Danan!</s>

We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?</s>Leave?</s>Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.</s>I'm very confused.</s>
Drink?</s>I need to talk to you alone.</s>
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?</s>Vecchio.</s>Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?</s>Yeah.</s>You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?</s>Bits and pieces.</s>She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.</s>And what about your own hand?</s>No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?</s>It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.</s>Oh, yeah?</s>Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.</s>And how do you bluff yourself?</s>Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.</s>Except this time, the mission IS a man.</s>That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.</s>John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.</s>I think you're right, Keith.</s>You want me to take over?</s>
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.</s>I know.</s>I've never admitted that to anyone.</s>

Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...</s>It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.</s>Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?</s>It is quite late enough.</s>But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --</s>Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.</s>Mama...</s>And that is my last word on the matter.</s>Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.</s>

Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.</s>It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.</s>I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?</s>
Mathesar? What is that?</s>It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.</s>
Because it's cheap like a budgie.</s>And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.</s>
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and...

What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?</s>No.</s>No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?</s>

Would you get me the city desk, please?</s>I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?</s>That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.</s>

You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.

I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.</s>So what, you left her there.</s>I shot her.</s>
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.</s>We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.</s>
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!</s>Transferring controls to manual.</s>
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.</s>Is that what you think?</s>I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.</s>

It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --</s>Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?</s>Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!</s>You're right -- I am a coward.</s>
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.</s>What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!</s>
You trust this Moonan guy?</s>I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage.

I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.</s>I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.</s>I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.</s>I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.</s>You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.</s>I'm not --  He's not.</s>

Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.</s>I see you read the book.</s>Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.</s>And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.</s>Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.</s>Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.</s>No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.</s>

Get out. Both of you.</s>Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.</s>
Is Simone back to earth yet?</s>Not quite.</s>I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.

And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!

Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?</s>It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.</s>Uncle Terrence.</s>Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...</s>Because Gaston was after it.</s>Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.</s>
Why don't you come in for a while?</s>I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.</s>
I'll call you.</s>Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?</s>What?</s>I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.</s>You look beautiful to me.</s>

Maybe. Maybe not.</s>I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.</s>Huh?</s>You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.</s>To his own daughter?</s>To anybody.</s>
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.</s>Not likely.</s>
I trust you, Bill.</s>Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.</s>
Did you know? Had you heard?</s>What?</s>The marriage!</s>Well, what does it matter to you?</s>Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.</s>
She was a good woman.</s>You didn't bring me here to talk about her.</s>No.</s>
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?</s>Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.</s>You're right.  We should build a collection first.</s>
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.</s>Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...</s>I get the picture.</s>Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.</s>
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?</s>Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.</s>

Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?</s>They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.</s>Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.</s>I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--</s>What dame?</s>Paine.</s>Oh--yeah--</s>He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--</s>Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?</s>Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--</s>Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--</s>I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us.

Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.</s>Good.</s>
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?</s>You wanna take the chance, Casper?</s>Not me. No way.</s>Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.</s>
Thea, what's wrong?</s>The General threatened me.</s>Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.</s>He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.</s>Well, tell, him.</s>I can't.</s>Why in the world can't you?</s>He hates all my race.</s>I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.</s>It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.</s>
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.</s>What do you mean, a part of Harry?</s>When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.</s>You think, in the sphere --</s>He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.</s>But how?</s>I don't know.</s>How can the sphere do that?</s>I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...</s>Which I told Barnes was attacking --</s>It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.</s>But why is he doing it?</s>He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.</s>His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?</s>No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.</s>
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.</s>Yes.</s>You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]</s>You've very kind Mr. Lovett.</s>I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.</s>Oh, I'm so glad.</s>Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "</s>Why, no.</s>"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."</s>Now, what would you like to do?</s>Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.</s>Splendid!</s>Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.</s>I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?</s>Oh, immediately.</s>Then it's done.</s>Oh, thank you. Thank you!</s>Thank you.</s>
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.</s>I can feel your pain.</s>
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.</s>You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...</s>
Yes -- he mentioned it.</s>So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.</s>I suppose.</s>So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.</s>
Are you drunk, Mulder?</s>I was until about an hour ago.</s>Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?</s>
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.</s>Who won? How did it end?</s>The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!</s>Shall we track them both?</s>The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.</s>
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.</s>Indeed.</s>
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.</s>Hey, that was last year.</s>
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?</s>If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.</s>
It would explain the suction- like appendages.</s>Like a leech.</s>
What's really on your wicked little mind?</s>The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.</s>That's a reasonable possibility.</s>He might've heard everything we said in the car.</s>What's your point?</s>We can't leave him to repeat anything.</s>Which one of us is elected to do the deed?</s>You're the man with the gun.</s>Naturally.</s>Naturally.</s>Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.</s>Only one way to find out.</s>
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.</s>Your wig. Remove your wig.</s>
All in, boss!</s>Move it out.</s>Movin' it out, boss.</s>
I terrible with mechanical things.</s>No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.</s>
Jean, your parents are here.</s>Hi Dad. Hi Nora.</s>
So how are you?</s>I'm okay.</s>You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?</s>Oh, nothing much.  You know...</s>Well...</s>...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.</s>Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?</s>Probably not.</s>Are you, are you out of work or something?</s>No, well...I've been trying to write.</s>Have you?</s>Yeah.</s>Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?</s>Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.</s>No, you can tell me.</s>Come on.</s>No, I am.  I am.</s>Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?</s>Nobody ever said it.</s>Really?</s>This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?</s>Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.</s>No, the reason I ask is--</s>You've always hated my taste in the past.</s>No, I haven't.</s>You have.</s>I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--</s>I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.</s>You're kidding me.</s>I've done no television whatsoever. No.</s>
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.</s>It wasn't like that.</s>Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.</s>
Morse code?</s>Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.</s>Where'd you learn S.O.S.?</s>"Titanic."</s>
No, no, that would be crazy --</s>You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...</s>I thought you'd think it was crazy.</s>IT IS CRAZY!</s>I know.  I know.  I am sorry.</s>
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.</s>Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!</s>
Where you gonna be?</s>Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?</s>I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.</s>
Fifty cents admission.</s>What?</s>It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.</s>
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.</s>There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.</s>
Amtrack?</s>What?</s>You just come in on Amtrack?</s>Uh, yes..</s>Business or pleasure?</s>Business.</s>
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.</s>You will not believe it.</s>Try me.</s>
Kids.</s>Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.</s>He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.</s>What happened?</s>His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.</s>Jesus!</s>Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.</s>I guess.</s>Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?</s>
Where do you think you're going?</s>Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.</s>I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.</s>

I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?</s>Sam's favorite.</s>
Is there anything else?</s>A drink...</s>Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.</s>Thanks.</s>
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?</s>Absolutely.</s>
I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.</s>You drive a hard bargain.</s>
Was quite excited, when he came in...</s>Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...</s>
Later for you, Luke.</s>I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?</s>
You're a fool, Babe.</s>I just couldn't stand seeing him again.</s>Running away is no solution.</s>
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.</s>I'd never get an abortion.</s>Why not?</s>That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.</s>In your opinion.</s>It would be my child.</s>Sounds like you speaks from experience.</s>
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.</s>I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.</s>And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.</s>What is it Miles?</s>I want... I want to...</s>
You're lucky, Flynne.</s>Funny, I don't feel lucky.</s>We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.</s>What if he caps me before you can make a move?</s>
Would you like us to sing to you?</s>That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...</s>
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.</s>So you're Cloverleaf?</s>No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.</s>
OK. Same again?</s>I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?</s>
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.</s>This is the guy that killed my partner.</s>You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?</s>Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?</s>
) You feel the symptoms?</s>My friend -- what can one say --</s>You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.</s>
Where does this go, Diane?</s>Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.</s>
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?</s>Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?</s>Would you? Actually, you could.</s>My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.</s>But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.</s>Of course.</s>You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.</s>Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?</s>A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.</s>
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.</s>Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.</s>Thank you, sir.</s>I'll take one.</s>
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.</s></s>I thought we discussed patience, Commander.</s>And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--</s>
Coffee, Ed?</s>I'm fine. Thanks.</s>No thanks, honey.</s>
Daddy!</s>He ain't our daddy!</s>
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!</s>No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.</s>
You cannot hide forever, Luke.</s>I will not fight you.</s>Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...</s>
Hey...</s>Shut up.</s>What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.</s>
Nice kid.</s>Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.</s>
Ann ... Ann!</s>It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.</s>
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...</s>What are you talking about?</s>That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.</s>You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.</s>Just promise you'll do it.</s>Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.</s>
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--</s>Well, what about artificial insemination?</s>What are you talking about?</s>You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.</s>What, by a st-stranger?</s>
I love you, Harry. I love you.</s>I love you too, Frances.</s>
Hey, Rock -- What happened?</s>'Bout what?</s>
Report.</s>He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.</s>
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.</s>Okay then, you're crazy.</s>
Did you kill all those guards?</s>Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...</s>They cost fifty pounds each!</s>Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...</s>
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.</s>Arrest me.</s>
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.</s>Mr. Hardy?</s>
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.</s>And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.</s>
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.</s>We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.</s>Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.</s>
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.</s>Fine.</s>
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.</s>I just do what the doctor says, babe.</s>You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.</s>Mama!</s>Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.</s>I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.</s>I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.</s>That's just Lilly's way.</s>And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.</s>Oh, don't be stupid.</s>You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.</s>
Why?</s>Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...</s>
Jabez!</s>Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.</s>Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.</s>You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.</s>
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.</s>Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?</s>If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.</s>Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.</s>Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.</s>You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.</s>Just a place.</s>Really, Lula, this ain't right!</s>Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?</s>Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?</s>No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!</s>Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.</s>Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.</s>No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.</s>I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?</s>
So where will you go?</s>She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!</s>
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.</s>Manager!!</s>
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.</s>Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --</s>I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.</s>
When did you start smoking?</s>I don't smoke?</s>You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.</s>Oh.</s>
You're the best, Lois.</s>I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.</s>Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.</s>Oh?</s>
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.</s>No, I'm gonna drive.</s>No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -</s>You're driving me nuts!</s>
Dead Cat!</s>Dead Cat?</s>Yeah.</s>Well it sure looks dead enough.</s>
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?</s>Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.</s>
Bob, rip up some bandages.</s>Pass me some whisky.</s>
I've changed.</s>Why young girls, Walter?</s>
He killed a man worked for him the other night.</s>So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?</s>
You live like a pig.</s>Can't you say something nice once?</s>Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.</s>
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.</s>What about "60 Minutes."</s>Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."</s>But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --</s>Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?</s>
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.</s>Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--</s>Pa! Shh!</s>How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?</s>
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.</s>In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.</s>Unfortunately.</s>Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.</s>My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.</s>Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...</s>I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.</s>I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.</s>No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.</s>Go on.</s>I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.</s>That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.</s>I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.</s>
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?</s>Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.</s>But what they done, they...</s>
I promise.</s>Scott?</s>
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?</s>Oh, yes.</s>Will I be seeing you again?</s>San Francisco's a long way from here.</s>I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.</s>How does Mother know what I like to do?</s>I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.</s>Oh. That. Rome.</s>Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...</s>In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.</s>Without any clothes on?</s>With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...</s>You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?</s>I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...</s>The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...</s>Yes, but...</s>...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...</s>Yes.</s>...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?</s>Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.</s>Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?</s>No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.</s>So you didn't go to school together.</s>No.</s>And you didn't come up here to see her.</s>No.</s>You were lying.</s>Yes, I was lying.</s>Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?</s>I wrote the letter.</s>What did it say?</s>It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.</s>But you tore it up.</s>Yes.</s>Why?</s>Because it seemed stupid and foolish.</s>Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!</s>I told you what happened in Rome!</s>Do you expect me to believe...?</s>I don't give a damn what you believe!</s>
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.</s>Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.</s>
I told you, no. I'm not that type.</s>Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.</s>Alright.</s>
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.</s>Relax, will you.</s>
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.</s>Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.</s>
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!</s>You okay?</s>
I'll take a chance.</s>Go for it.</s>It's like a to-do list, but for my life.</s>
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--</s>--Howard Hunt?</s>Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.</s>Any idea what he did?</s>Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--</s>--Teddy Kennedy?</s>Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--</s>
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?</s>Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!</s>
Jesus Christ!</s>I can't believe you made it!</s>
That was too close.</s>But we gotta find out what's going on in there.</s>
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.</s>I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!</s>
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?</s>I guess that's what he looked like.</s>We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.</s>What'd he look like again?</s>Short fella. Pale face.</s>Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?</s>I didn't see nothin'.</s>Okay. Go on.</s>
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.</s>I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.</s>
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?</s>They all are. Football's on.</s>Keep 'em there for a little while.</s>
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.</s>Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!</s>So boys, how was your first day?</s>
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?</s>Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.</s>I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.</s>

With grenadine, right?</s>When I was twenty.</s>Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?</s>
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...</s>Really?</s>Really.</s>For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.</s>But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.</s>Sometimes I do.</s>My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...</s>

When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.</s>Why is that?</s>Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.</s>I wouldn't believe it?</s>I don't know. I just think that you would love it.</s>But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.</s>What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.</s>
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…</s>I'm sorry - what have you noticed?</s>

Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.</s>Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.</s>Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.</s>Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?</s>Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?</s>What?</s>Cone.</s>Huh... what cone?</s>Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.</s>I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.</s>I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.</s>

It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.</s>No.  I mean it, thank you.</s>
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.</s>Any good?</s>It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.</s>You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?</s>It's good what you're doing.</s>
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?</s>Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.</s>I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.</s>I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.</s>Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?</s>Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?</s>
It sounds far away.</s>Not far enough. Come on.</s>
Dolt!</s>Sorry.</s>

When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.</s>If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?</s>Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.</s>
Great car.</s>The best.</s>I love that car.</s>I'm very happy for you two.</s>
Your Majesty</s>There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?</s>
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?</s>He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.</s>
Southern light.</s>What?</s>Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.</s>I'll buy a plant.</s>You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.</s>
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.</s>Bitch!</s>

That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.</s>...things change.</s>...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...</s>I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...</s>And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.</s>I'm sure you would.</s>
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...</s>Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.</s>Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.</s>

You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?</s>We've just lost cabin pressure.</s>What did you say... ?</s>What is wrong with you?</s>Say my name.</s>What... ?</s>Say my name!  What's my name!?</s>Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...</s>Marla, no, wait...</s>

Because you're going to get these guys for me.</s>Okay boss.   Where are they?</s>If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?</s>You didn't say find them.

You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...</s>No, I'm fine... really...</s>You're all right... you sure...</s>
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...</s>A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?</s>
Where is Banister in all this?</s>Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.</s>
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.</s>You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.</s>
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.</s>No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.</s>And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.</s>That's obvious.</s>You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?</s>
Is this the same stuff you made last week?</s>No, no, it's different.</s>I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.</s>It tastes different.</s>I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!</s>

She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.</s>I can't let him down.</s>
So...what's so terrible about that?</s>Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.</s>No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...</s>Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--</s>I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...</s>

Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.

Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.</s>No sweat. Only do me a favor?</s>Sure.</s>Stop calling me Vernon.</s>

You callin' me a thief, my man?</s>No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.</s>And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?</s>I don't know?</s>
What did you think you were doing in his tent?</s>Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.</s>You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.</s>Her hands and feet were tied.</s>What did you do?</s>I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.</s>I was talking about the girl.</s>Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.</s>
You got Bank Americard?</s>What now, Sonny?</s>Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...</s>
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?</s>Yeah.  But he ain't here now.</s>Know where he is?</s>Follow me.</s>

Yes, Joe, yes--right away.</s>What is it?</s>Sam Foley--dead!</s>Great saints!</s>Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--</s>Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?</s>Taylor, my dear.</s>Can't that wait, Hubert?</s>No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper.

Three or four millionaires in here right now.</s>They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?</s>Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here.

I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?</s>
Stop.</s>Goosed!</s>Give me the Valium.</s>

Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.</s>It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.</s>With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.</s>

Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?</s>I don't know... I think he went out the back.</s>Can I look for myself?</s>

How could you do this to me?</s>I'm in love with you.</s>Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?</s>
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?</s>No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.</s>
It's... it's not like that.</s>I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.</s>
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--</s>Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.</s>Joanna said that?</s>
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.</s>Fine.</s>
What's this?</s>Just some sketches.</s>May I?</s>
I went out.</s>What's that kissing on the mouth shit?</s>
John Anderton was my friend!</s>You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...</s>
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?</s>Girl, do you still sing and dance?</s>No, I'm a different person now, Harry.</s>
Before we do this.</s>We're doing something -- ?</s>Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.</s>
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...</s>That's terrible news...</s>
...she can go up there.</s>Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--</s>Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.</s>
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!</s>It's not going to hurt me to get up.</s>Sit down!</s>You talk as if I were Asta.</s>All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.</s>

How did you do that?</s>I don't remember in detail, there were so many.</s>Did you call someone you knew?</s>I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.</s>Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'</s>

I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?</s>Me.</s>Yeah.</s>Mm.</s>Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?</s>I think I'd better stay here for a while.</s>
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.</s>No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it.

The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...</s>
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.</s>Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.</s>
We could pass for that.</s>- you got to be blonde -</s>We could dye our hair.</s>- and you got to be girls.</s>We could -</s>
Dude!</s>What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.</s>
Yes.</s>There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.</s>You are?</s>Yes.</s>
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...</s>Where the hell is she?</s>
Did you get him in the head?</s>No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!</s>
You gonna steal my truck?</s>Make yourself at home. You done it already.</s>
Almost.</s>I said get out.</s>
But... won't you be de-rezzed?</s>Probably.</s>
Who are "they?"</s>I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.</s>Then, what good are you?</s>I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.</s>That's a lie...</s>Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.</s>
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.</s>Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.</s>
All right!  What'd she say?</s>I don't know.</s>
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?</s>Got it. Over.</s>Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.</s>
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.</s>I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.</s>
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?</s>Whichever one I want.</s>
Foreigners! Fuck!</s>Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?</s>
It's not talking, it's mimicking.</s>Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.</s>
Will you do me one favor?</s>Ray, you heard him...</s>What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?</s>
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --</s>I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.</s>
Your ideas never work out.</s>Oh really? Starbucks?</s>
All of you!</s>Bank branch!</s>
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?</s>Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.</s>
Why should I?</s>Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.</s>
I agree.</s>I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.</s>
To peace on earth, Major.</s>Peace on earth.</s>
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.</s>I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.</s>Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.</s>Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.</s>Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?</s>I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.</s>You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.</s>I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.</s>Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?</s>I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.</s>
Besides, we don't know the city and--</s>Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!</s>
What do you mean, old and ugly?</s>You got me beat on both accounts.</s>The hell I do.</s>
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.</s>Why?</s>Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.</s>
It's gone now.</s>Oh, Jesse...</s>
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.</s>But...</s>
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?</s>I don't know!</s>Suga!</s>
You weren't gonna say goodbye?</s>I was, later.</s>Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.</s>I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..</s>I know exactly what you mean.</s>How could you?</s>I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?</s>...Something like that.</s>
On the table.</s>Sorry?</s>You have to lay it on the table.</s>Uh, I don't want to bet it all.</s>
How'd he know about the treasure?</s>Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-</s>
Why did you do that?</s>I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.</s>A day like any other. People come, people go.</s>Give me a drag.</s>
God, your sister's really hot.</s>Shut up.</s>

I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.</s>You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?</s>Jacques!</s>
You said there was a way across.</s>There is.</s>

Who is this man?</s>He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.</s>
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.</s>Where are we going?</s>Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?</s>No -- she didn't.</s>Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!</s>
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.</s>I'll see you tomorrow.</s>Absolutely.</s>
You want to see me, Senator?</s>Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?</s>The ranger's notices? No idea at all.</s>No?</s>No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.</s>By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?</s>Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.</s>Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--</s>That's right.</s>Oh, now--that won't do--</s>Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--</s>You're the best nurse I can think of--</s>Nice *compliment*!</s>I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--</s>No?</s>You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--</s>And I'm an old hand at following instructions--</s>You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--</s>Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--</s>You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.</s>Yeah?  And what else?</s>What do you mean?</s>Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--</s>I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--</s>
Boy--</s>They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.</s>Oh, what do they know?</s>
And you're gonna die after me, right?</s>I guess so.</s>Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.</s>
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.</s>I followed them.  An hour from the train station.</s>How many men?</s>I couldn't tell.</s>Joyce?</s>I don't know.</s>We need the plate to negotiate with.</s>
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff.

Can you walk? Puedes caminar?</s>She say she in great pain.</s>Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?</s>
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?</s>I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .</s>
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.</s>Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.</s>Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.</s>Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.</s>
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.</s>Back off, John.</s>
Oh my God.</s>Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.</s>
It's <u>Otho</u>!</s>Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?</s>
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...</s>I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!</s>
Okay, thanks.</s>I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.</s>That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?</s>Okay, okay. Bye.</s>
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.</s>Did he have to die for me to get it?!</s>It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...</s>What about happiness, Mother?</s>Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.</s>

Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?</s>Yes, Mr. President.</s>We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.</s>That was Mr. Kennedy.</s>You don't think he was a hero?</s>

You know what, I'm just gonna crash.</s>Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.</s>Nah.  I have curfew.</s>
Hey.</s>Hey.</s>
Why should that make such a difference?</s>Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.</s>
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?</s>I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.</s>I'm getting too old for this game.</s>

What are you doing out here alone?</s>Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.</s>Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?</s>
Stop that.</s>Why?</s>
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?</s>Sure.</s>
That would take weeks.</s>Months.</s>
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.</s>Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.</s>
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.</s>Yes?</s>Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.</s>I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.</s>Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.</s>That's a very wise deduction, General.</s>Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?</s>
Well, whatever you think.</s>I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.</s>Sounds like you may be on to something.</s>Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.</s>
A condition...</s>Exactly. A condition.</s>
You know damn well that's not what I meant.</s>All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'</s>
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.</s>I need to sit down a minute.</s>Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.</s>

I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?</s>Just the face.</s>Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.</s>
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?</s>But I got a train to make.</s>It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.</s>But what about all these other people?</s>We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.

How do you feel?</s>All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...</s>Forget it.</s>
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.</s>We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.</s>Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?</s>Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.</s>And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.</s>It's your call, Will. What do we do?</s>
No.</s>Talking about it as a...</s>No.</s>As a robbery.</s>As a "robbery"?!  No.</s>Well.  Well...</s>Hey.</s>
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.</s>He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?</s>Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.</s>You mean you blew it.</s>Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.</s>He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.</s>No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.</s>

Well... we don't smile. How about some music?</s>Is that customary?</s>It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.</s>I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.</s>Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?</s>I will start with you.</s>That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.</s>And what is your profession?</s>Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.</s>And what do you do for mankind?</s>For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.</s>You are something we do not have in Russia.</s>Thank you. Thank you.</s>That is why I believe in the future of my country.</s>I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it.

Ni- notchka.</s>Ni-notchka.</s>That is correct.</s>Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?</s>Your general appearance is not distasteful.</s>Thank you.</s>Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.</s>Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?</s>You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.</s>Oh, I see. What do you use instead?</s>I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.</s>What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?</s>You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.</s>You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...</s>You repeat yourself.</s>I'd like to say it a thousand times.</s>Don't do it, please.</s>I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.</s>It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.</s>The bayonet? Did you really?</s>I was wounded before Warsaw.</s>Wounded? How?</s>I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?</s>I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.</s>A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.</s>Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.</s>Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.</s>

Okay.</s>I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.</s>Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.</s>
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.</s>Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?</s>Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.</s>

I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!</s>Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes.

You went to school with these people.</s>Come on.</s>We've spent a lot of time discussing those years.

You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.</s>I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --</s>
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.</s>Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.</s>

Come on, honey, let's get out of here.</s>But I'm having a good time...</s>
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?</s>No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.</s>

You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.</s>Why wasn't I insulted?</s>You was insulted, but you don't know it.</s>Then I demand an apology!</s>That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.</s>You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?</s>He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.</s>Why didn't his niece slap your face?</s>She did.</s>What did you say to her?</s>
Patience, Willow.</s>Courage, Willow.</s>
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.</s>With who?</s>Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.</s>

Hon?</s>Yah?</s>Prowler needs a jump.</s>
Are there any balls down there?!</s>'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!</s>
Now let's talk about you chaps.</s>We'd rather stay.</s>We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.</s>You're kidding.</s>But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?</s>

Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.</s>But it's too late.  I got him back the job...</s>No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.</s>

Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.

You know, when even barbers used 'em?</s>I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.</s>

Yeah?</s>I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.</s>That's a good one.</s>I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?</s>

Captain Solo.  What's the situation?</s>There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.</s>Good, and Commander Skywalker?</s>He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.</s>With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.</s>The Empire won't look for you out here.

We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.</s>Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.</s>
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.</s>At least you walked.</s>If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?</s>Wanted to see how good you were.

Why did you do it?</s>Why'd I do what?</s>Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.

Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...</s>
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!</s>You apprehended him after he gave himself up --</s>It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.</s>Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.</s>Even Joey Venza?!</s>He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.</s>What about when she identifies him?!</s>If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.</s>

Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.</s>Not really...  what's this?</s>

...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.</s>Excellent picture.</s>We got a treatment on it yet?</s>No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.</s>Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!</s>

"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.</s>Of you?</s>Yes.</s>I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.</s>But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.</s>He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.</s>He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin</s>No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.</s>How can you be sure?</s>I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.</s>

Did you talk to him?</s>Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?</s>
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?</s>Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.</s>

All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?</s>Come on, Joe.</s>Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?</s>If you love me, Joe.</s>Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.</s>Joe, I can't look at you any more.</s>Nobody asked you to.</s>
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.</s>Out of my way!</s>
Is that when you split up?</s>No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.</s>
It's got Hazy!</s>What has?</s>One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...</s>
My very good friend! What a surprise.</s>Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.</s>
Will you be able to handle that...?</s>Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.</s>

Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.</s>Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!</s>Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.

You all right?</s>I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.</s>
Aren't you glad we waited?</s>I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.</s>Well, thanks a lot.</s>
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.</s>How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?</s>
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.</s>Let him trust Quintus.</s>Quintus is overly idealistic.</s>I never knew a more idealistic man than you.</s>Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.</s>I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...</s>What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.</s>

I don't think that this is the time, or the place.</s>I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.</s>An inquiry into what?</s>For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?</s>Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.</s>Did I say it was a natural death?</s>
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?</s>Yes!</s>Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.</s>

Is that clear?</s>Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...</s>I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.</s>

You'd think they could at least send a ship.

I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.

Yes, Colonel.</s>Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it.

We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.</s>

Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?</s>I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --</s>Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.</s>Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.</s>No - absinthe.</s>Yes -- that --</s>
There has to be.</s>I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.</s>There must be half a million dollars here though.</s>
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.</s>Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?</s>
Oh, Ray... no...</s>You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...</s>
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...</s>That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.</s>
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.</s>[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.</s>If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.</s>
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.</s>Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.</s>Have another?</s>No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.</s>
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.</s>She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.</s>
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --</s>Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?</s>
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!</s>Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.</s>
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!</s>Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?</s>
A simple 'please' would suffice...</s>Fluck you!</s>
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.</s>And he didn't have them?</s>He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.</s>Is that all?</s>No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...</s>And you believed him?</s>I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?</s>
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.</s>No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.</s>
A book?</s>That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.</s>Has it got any sports in it?</s>
I knew it!</s>Don't you ever heat that stuff up.</s>Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?</s>Lisa Fremont.</s>You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.</s>She expects me to marry her.</s>That's normal.</s>I don't want to.</s>That's abnormal.</s>I'm not ready for marriage.</s>Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.</s>She's all right.</s>
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.</s>What was your relationship with her?</s>
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.</s>Spare me.</s>I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.</s>
Hot goddamn day!</s>Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.</s>Not even for lunch?</s>I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.</s>
I see.</s>...I know this must look... funny.</s>No, no –</s>
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.</s>Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...</s>
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.</s>Is... is it... loaded?</s>Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.</s>
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?</s>Daddy, *please*...</s>
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.</s>I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.</s>
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.</s>I'll try.</s>
So he was indicted?</s>Yes.</s>
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?</s>Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!</s>
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!</s>Sir? Right now?</s>Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!</s>
I really must thank you.</s>I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.</s>I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.</s>Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.</s>You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.</s>
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.</s>And what am I?</s>Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?</s>You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!</s>
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?</s>She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.</s>You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?</s>Couple months before I was born--</s>Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--</s>
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private!</s>A ragione. A ragione.</s>Hmm. C'e questa...</s>
I got...</s>Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.</s>
Ow?...</s>It'l be alright.</s>It will.</s>It doesn't hurt.</s>No?</s>
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.</s>Fine, I'll stop.</s>
Got any more ideas?</s>I don't make policy.</s>
I don't.</s>You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?</s>
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...</s>I grew up on your mov...</s>
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.</s>Remember Braddock?</s>That bad?</s>Worse.</s>Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.</s>
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.</s>You have my word. Paul?</s>
Wait...I need that...</s>Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.</s>
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.</s>Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.</s>I don't.</s>
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.</s>What -- what lesson?</s>
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.</s>I don't want to learn that!</s>
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.</s>Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?</s>
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.</s>What the hell you talkin' bout?</s>Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.</s>How do you know she did that?</s>I was there, I saw her do it.</s>Well, you weren't supposed to be there.</s>I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.</s>Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.</s>Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.</s>
Drive.</s>We're not gonna hurt you.</s>Drive.</s>Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.</s>Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.</s>No he won't.</s>Goddammit--</s>We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--</s>
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!</s>Quit?  She wants to quit?</s>Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!</s>
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...</s>What's wrong?  Are you alright?</s>I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there</s>... What's going on?</s>Just do it, Amy, please, go.</s>
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.</s>I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.</s>Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.</s>If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?</s>
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.</s>We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --</s>
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!</s>What is it?</s>
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.</s>That's no problem. We have those in stock.</s>Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?</s>With identification.</s>
How long do we stay in here?</s>How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...</s>
There.</s>Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!</s>Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?</s>Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?</s>
You know her?</s>Uh-uh.  Before my time.</s>
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.</s>Fair enough.  The river.</s>
But I'm not done with the machine --</s>Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.</s>
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.</s>Sorry.</s>
Can I ask you something?</s>Sure, Jimmy.</s>What does J.F.K. stand for?</s>John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</s>Was he the president?</s>Yes, Jimmy</s>
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?</s>White meat will be fine...</s>
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?</s>I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.</s>
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.</s>You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.</s>Doesn't matter.</s>Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?</s>
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.</s>Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?</s>Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.</s>No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.</s>Is everything fine?</s>Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.</s>I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.</s>I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?</s>
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....</s>A poison...?</s>Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.</s>Sexuality??? What do you mean?</s>You ever fuck a Jewish girl?</s>What??!?</s>Did you ever fuck one, Guy?</s>What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?</s>And? WHat did you notice?</s>Notice? Like what...?</s>Jewish girls like to give head, right?</s>I don't know. Is that right?</s>And Jewish men like to get it.</s>Everybody likes to, don't they?</s>Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?</s>Why?</s>Because the Jew is essentially female.</s>Female...</s>Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.</s>Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?</s>You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.</s>Danny, what makes you think you know all this?</s>Let's just say I've done due diligence.</s>So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.</s>The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.</s>
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?</s>We all deserve to wear white.</s>
I'm not going!</s>You don't have a choice.</s>Mom...please.</s>
We know so little about each other --</s>We know all that we need to know --</s>But there's so much to tell you --</s>Don't.  That will come later.</s>Will it?</s>Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --</s>
When is mommy coming back?</s>Soon.  Very soon.</s>
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.</s>Shush.</s>
Well, isn't it?</s>I... suppose so, yes.</s>So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?</s>No. No. Let's go upstairs.</s>That's more like it.</s>
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!</s>Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.</s>Oh yeah!</s>
...do you copy?</s>Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.</s>Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?</s>I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.</s>
Car wash, Captain?</s>Absolutely.</s>
Peter, you're bleeding.</s>It's fine.  Tell me what--</s>Oh, Ben gets through everything.</s>Aunt May, what happened?</s>I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.</s>How is he?</s>He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.</s>
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!</s>And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.</s>
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?</s>Maybe! Is it impossible?</s>Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?</s>
And you struck him right here in our house—?</s>Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.</s>
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?</s>The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.</s>
Promise?</s>Promise.</s>
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.</s>Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?</s>
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??</s>I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.</s>No.  I don't work here.</s>Huh?</s>
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?</s>Uh... Yes, of course!</s>
I intend to find out.</s>I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.</s>I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.</s>
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?</s>Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.</s>So?</s>He does it all by himself.</s>
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.</s>I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?</s>Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.</s>Would you like me to take you through your lines?</s>Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.</s>Hand it over.  Basic plot?</s>I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.</s>Well done you.</s>
No!  He's never done that before.</s>Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.</s>
You didn't walk out here.</s>It's mine all right.</s>Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.</s>
Much too blue.</s>Not blue enough.</s>
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.</s>Easy.  Slow is best.</s>
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.</s>Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-</s>And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.</s>How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?</s>
I can't give you a lift back tonight.</s>Don't worry.</s>
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.</s>Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?</s>Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.</s>Then why not take it?</s>
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...</s>I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...</s>
All of us?</s>Yeah.</s>
You tell Maggie.</s>No, you tell her.</s>No, no.  You're her best friend.</s>No.</s>You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.</s>Yeah.</s>Maybe she hasn't read the paper...</s>
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.</s>It's that easy?</s>Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.</s>
That's Razor and Blade.</s>Razor and Blade.</s>
How's it feel?</s>How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.</s>
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?</s>Oh yeah, you bet.</s>

We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.</s>But the bridge has been pulled down!</s>The English are rebuilding it.</s>
Come on, I'm trying to help here.</s>Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.</s>
How?</s>I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.</s>
You ever seen a train run on a woman?</s>Nuh-uh.</s>Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.</s>
Do I have a choice in this?</s>Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.</s>
He killed that guy without feeling anything.</s>Not a thing.</s>When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.</s>Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.</s>
I can't believe it's the same horse.</s>We still have a way to go.</s>How much longer do you think?</s>
Take him off the air.</s>What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.</s>I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.</s>
Where's Betty?</s>She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.</s>
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.</s>Boy, those were the days.</s>
Who is...'V'ger'...?</s>V'ger is that which programmed me.</s>Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?</s>
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.</s>Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?</s>Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.</s>Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.</s>
You should give it to someone with only one leg.</s>One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?</s>I know a guy who only has one leg.</s>
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.</s>Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.</s>
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?</s>He's "discovering" India.</s>
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.</s>No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.</s>
What's the matter?</s>What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.</s>If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --</s>-- Then you don't need me.</s>But if it's someone else I do.</s>
Repoed this morning.</s>I'll provide you with transportation.</s>And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...</s>

Morpheus.</s>What?</s>Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."</s>
What do you mean?</s>I mean, it's a good story.</s>Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?</s>Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?</s>
I found it...</s>And?</s>Drains right into the Central Reservoir.</s>Get her on-line.  Now!</s>
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....</s>None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.</s>What do you mean?</s>I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?</s>

No no no no no no no no no...</s>Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...</s>
Come on out a minute, okay?</s>Okay.</s>
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.</s>I understand, I think. Other women?</s>Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore.

Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?</s>No--no.</s>Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?</s>I would like to.</s>You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!</s>Why should you?</s>But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!</s>

Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?</s>I took the initiative.</s>You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.</s>I was the one who brought that money in...</s>I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007.

Whereabouts in Italy?</s>Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.</s>Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.</s>No, really?</s>Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.</s>

...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?</s>Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --</s>They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --</s>Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --</s>You mean you know about this?</s>Know about it?

You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --</s>You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work!

You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!</s>
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.</s>Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?</s>What?</s>You can handle this.</s>
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.</s>Oh shit.</s>
Was that for real down there?</s>I'm afraid so.</s>
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?</s>Sure, man --</s>She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...</s>
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.</s>Then who does?</s>I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.</s>Me?</s>Or you --  Or you --</s>
Are you alright?</s>I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.</s>
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.</s>What are you talking about?</s>The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.</s>That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.</s>Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...</s>
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.</s>Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.</s>She was very faint.

You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!</s>Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.</s>
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?</s>Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?</s>
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?</s>I live here.</s>I thought you were going to the mixer?</s>I had to change. Did anyone call?</s>Just some asshole trying to scare me.</s>
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?</s>Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.</s>
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.</s>But not the only victim, right?</s>My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.</s>
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.</s>Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.</s>You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.</s>You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.</s>It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.</s>Who was she?</s>Aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. They caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. She was twelve. Don't ask. It was craziness, believe me.  They used to come here sometimes.  Don't ask.</s>
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.</s>Yeah...?</s>Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!</s>
What word?</s>I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!</s>How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?</s>You said it again!</s>What, "is"?</s>No, no ... not "is"!</s>
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.</s>Fuck you Vincenzo.</s>Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.</s>I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.</s>

It never crossed my mind.</s>Of course.</s>It was just an idea.</s>Bad idea.</s>I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.</s>Reflect.</s>That's right.</s>You think reflection is good.</s>It's very good, indeed.</s>How's that?</s>By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.</s>

Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.</s>Yes John!</s>
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.</s>I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.</s>

Cameron.</s>Cameron?</s>Yes.</s>Really?</s>
Who?</s>The men. Do any of them still live around here?</s>Two men left town right after it happened.</s>You're not telling me something.</s>
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.</s>This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.</s>You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.</s>
No, really, I really like him a lot.</s>No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.</s>
S-S-Stuff.</s>"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?</s>
You got that wrong, mister. I am.</s>Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.</s>Just tell me where I can find him, friend.</s>Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.</s>
Come into the study a minute.</s>Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.</s>
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?</s>The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.</s>By your Austrian?</s>Yeah.</s>
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!</s>But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?</s>I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!</s>
I see...</s>I am sorry, Duncan...</s>
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.</s>Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.</s>
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?</s>Yeah.</s>She's grown up some, hasn't she?</s>Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.</s>
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.</s>I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.</s>We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.</s>I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?</s>
Macbeth, right?</s>Right.</s>Kat a fan, too?</s>Yeah...</s>
I was going to fix you breakfast.</s>You were asleep.</s>I bought you a lot of new things.</s>
What in the hell did you do that for?</s>I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.</s>That's not what I was worried about.</s>
You smoke Pall Mall?</s>Yeah.</s>
God damn son of a...</s>Isn't that a daisy?</s>Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.</s>Now Ed, are we cross?</s>
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.</s>Good morning, Mr. Dickson.</s>Got my letter?</s>Yes, thank you.</s>Hello, Helen.</s>
Have a nice trip.</s>Thanks. I will.</s>
Can you pay some attention to me?</s>Oh, yes.</s>Insolent young cub!</s>You mean Baron von Gaigern?</s>Baron!</s>Well, he's a gentleman!</s>
Are you open?</s>Yeah.</s>Pack of cigarettes.</s>
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...</s>I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.</s>HER NAME, ABBE.</s>
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.</s>Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.</s>
But Jake... I didn't say anything...</s>Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!</s>Jake...</s>
Harry? Harry, where are you?!</s>Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?</s>I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.</s>Calm down, Frances.</s>Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!</s>
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.</s>He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.</s>I told you this was a simple-minded play.</s>Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.</s>I know.</s>Stay home tonight!</s>Oh, Paul--</s>You're married!  You've already got a husband!</s>He's a ghost!</s>He's alive!</s>Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.</s>If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?</s>Thank you, kind sir.</s>A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.</s>A what kind of doctor?</s>A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.</s>That's an interesting piece of news.</s>You're the only woman he ever took out.</s>Not true.</s>Still lives with his mother.</s>You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?</s>How did she lose her feet?</s>In a railroad accident many years ago.</s>I was afraid to ask.</s>Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.</s>I didn't know that.</s>A lot of people don't.</s>J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.</s>I don't really know.</s>To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.</s>
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -</s>Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.</s>
Allow me, Comrade.</s>No, thank you.</s>
Hello?</s>It's Daniel.</s>Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--</s>-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.</s>A million! I don't have that kind of money.</s>Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.</s>I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.</s>Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.</s>
Louis</s>Randolph!</s>Hope you don't mind my popping in--</s>
Well... is it loaded?</s>I tell you "officer", it wasn't...</s>
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?</s>Nothing.</s>Nothing?</s>
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?</s>That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.</s>He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"</s>
What's the idea, Anne?</s>The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.</s>Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?</s>Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?</s>Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?</s>Your house?</s>O-o-oh, I get you—  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?</s>
Why?</s>I just wondered.</s>Just wondered what?</s>Why.</s>Why what?</s>Why you have to go out there.</s>I don't have to. I want to.</s>Is it the money?</s>Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.</s>Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-</s>The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.</s>I just asked a simple question.</s>And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...</s>
There isn't time.</s>Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.</s>Another distraction.  It's not right.</s>Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?</s>Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.</s>I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.</s>All right.</s>Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.</s>Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.</s>Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.</s>Football is my life.</s>You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.</s>
Yeah, just an idea I had.</s>She's very beautiful.</s>Just an idea I had.</s>

We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....</s>Like a suicide thing?</s>Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.</s>I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.</s>
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.</s>oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?</s>Yeah...?</s>We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.</s>I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.</s>No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?</s>It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.</s>Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?</s>No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.</s>Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.</s>Ok</s>

You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.</s>That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.</s>It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.</s>I don't know anything about computers.</s>That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.</s>What's that?</s>An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.</s>You do?</s>"Straw God" changed my life.</s>You saw that?</s>I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.</s>Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.</s>I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.</s>I'm already dead.</s>
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.</s>That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.</s>That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...</s>C'mon, you know that won't...</s>We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.</s>

If I agree to this, I walk right now?</s>That's right.</s>I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.</s>Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.</s>

That's Oprah talking.</s>Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.</s>This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.</s>

She could be telling the truth.</s>Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.</s>
Dorothy Parker--</s>You like her?</s>I love the way she writes.</s>Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."</s>But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?</s>True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?</s>Sure, why?</s>Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.</s>Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--</s>
So, whaddya think?</s>It's fine.</s>So where's all your stuff?</s>
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.</s>Yes, she would.</s>I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.</s>What would your mother say to that?</s>This is my wedding.</s>Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?</s>He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?</s>If you think it'll be all right.</s>
Invitations.</s>Invitations?</s>Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.</s>Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?</s>All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.</s>Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .</s>Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.</s>
What?</s>They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.</s>That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter.</s>
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.</s>Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.</s>What are you talking about?</s>An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i></s>Where?</s>In downtown Sydney for a start.</s>
P.E.T.N ...</s>What?</s>
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.</s>Queer?</s>Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -</s>
What?</s>The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --</s>
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?</s>I don't know anymore.</s>
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.</s>Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?</s>The best Burtless movie ever made.</s>
What's your name, sailor ?</s>Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.</s>Lance Johnson? The surfer?</s>That's right, sir.</s>
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.</s>Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.</s>We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.</s>They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.</s>Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.</s>
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?</s>Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?</s>No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.</s>Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.</s>Major, you're talking like one of them!</s>Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.</s>Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.</s>Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?</s>I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.</s>But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.</s>But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?</s>If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.</s>And you'd like to see that?</s>General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.</s>Do you think we'd cheat?</s>No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.</s>Do you think they would cheat?</s>Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.</s>Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.</s>
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.</s>That depends on the man.</s>
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?</s>They're coming.</s>
One shot stopping.</s>'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.</s>
...You leaving?</s>Isn't that what you want?</s>
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?</s>You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.</s>
Yeah.  Why don't we?</s>What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.</s>
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...</s>Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...</s>
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?</s>Margo.</s>Margo? Lunching in public?</s>It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.</s>She may be later than you think...</s>
I have some very good memories there.</s>What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.</s>Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.</s>
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.</s>Did you?  Kudos.</s>
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.</s>So this break... is a break-up.</s>Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.</s>
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?</s>Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?</s>No.  I'm not going near him.</s>
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.</s>Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.</s>I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?</s>
See you.</s>It's possible</s>Hang in there.</s>
What's in the satchel?</s>It's full a money.</s>That'll be the day.</s>
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.</s>If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.</s>Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.</s>
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.</s>I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.</s>A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...</s>
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.</s>I do.</s>
New record.</s>Let's get out of here.</s>
Fuck you.</s>Or shitty!!  Otis!!</s>
-no Cheesy Poofs.</s>-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?</s>
What can I say?</s>Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.</s>
I take it your not mad at me.</s>Wouldn't go that far.</s>
Maybe two cars.</s>A car sounds sensible.</s>And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.</s>
You know him?</s>No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before</s>
Let's go, Jake, wake up!</s>Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?</s>We're from...</s>I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.</s>They wanna talk to you.</s>About what?</s>I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.</s>For what?</s>
Over there!</s>What do you see?</s>At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.</s>
Show me.</s>Here?</s>Now. Show now.</s>
Hey, man.</s>Sorry, can you give us a moment?</s>No, I can’t. We’re late for a dance lesson. I guess you’ll have to finish up later.</s>
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.</s>How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?</s>
Long live the fighters!</s>Long live the fighters!</s>
Who...who kills me?</s>You have nothing to fear, William.</s>
Scotty, how long is this bay?</s>About 60 feet, Admiral.</s>That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?</s>I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?</s>
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.</s>And you never cried -</s>I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.</s>
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.</s>You're a silly girl.</s>Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.</s>I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-</s>Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.</s>
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?</s>I'll say.</s>
-- what's the problem, honey?</s>-- his car. They have it blocked.</s>Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?</s>
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.</s>I heard that too.</s>Did you hear his son is still around?</s>
403 41st Street, kids: home.</s>I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.</s>By day? No sweat.</s>
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.</s>I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.</s>
Go on, fetch.</s>I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.</s>
They're not usually graduate students.</s>SWAT wants to go in.</s>What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?</s>
Why?</s>Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.</s>I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--</s>--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.</s>Something was wrong.</s>Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.</s>I guess--</s>
Waddaya mean, Ralph?</s>Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.</s>Hiya.</s>
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?</s>And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?</s>
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!</s>Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.</s>
If we still have one.</s>Yes...</s>You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?</s>Would you excuse me?</s>Sure.</s>
I'm ready.</s>Soon as I finish my coffee.</s>
You hold great hope for this meeting.</s>I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.</s>
What's the matter?</s>My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.</s>
Do you feel much about the things you did?</s>I didn't do anything wrong.</s>Tell that to Muskie.</s>Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.</s>During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.</s>Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.</s>You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.</s>I didn't.</s>But you know who did.</s>When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?</s>
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?</s>Feast your eyes.</s>
Do you guys feel like painting?</s>What color?</s>Red.</s>I love red!  That's my favorite color!</s>
What do you think?</s>Call upstairs, see what you can find out.</s>Right.</s>T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.</s>
Thanks for the shower.</s>I want you both to stay.</s>
It's a good thing you pay me well.</s>Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--</s>No.  He checked out okay--</s>
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——</s>If you're gonna do it, better do it now.</s>
You have to tell us now.</s>I...I...</s>
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.</s>And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?</s>Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!</s>So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.</s>Do you hear him? Do you?</s>
Does it bother you?</s>They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.</s>
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.</s>Berry-picking.</s>Yes.  The old-fashioned way.</s>And what's that?</s>With our hands.</s>
Who is it?</s>I'm at the door.</s>Go way. I'll call a cop.</s>Pop, will you let me in?</s>Where the hell are you?</s>Right here. At the door.</s>
We'll make them pay for this.</s>I'm out.</s>WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!</s>Who's next? You? Me? Bob?</s>
Leavin', boy?</s>Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.</s>Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.</s>
Run, Snake...They're coming.</s>Who?</s>
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.</s>He'll be okay. He's a good kid.</s>
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.</s>Thanks, Stan. I owe you.</s>
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?</s>Witness?</s>No way they could have seen it.</s>
What's that? Another tape?</s>Yes, I just found it on the step.</s>
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.</s>Ya, that rack holds six ties.</s>
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.</s>Speak.</s>Dr. Bright has escaped.</s>
You have to follow me?</s>I dunno. I --</s>
Sid, what happened?</s>I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...</s>
Long wait for a bus?</s>Yes.</s>
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.</s>Doesn't make sense.</s>Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.</s>
You attract a crowd.</s>Yeah, great.</s>I heard about the Kentucky gag order...</s>I don't know what to do.</s>
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.</s>I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.</s>And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?</s>I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.</s>Spoken like a true believer.</s>What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?</s>How do you mean?</s>Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.</s>'My father's house has many mansions.'</s>Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.</s>
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.</s>I took the early rounds.</s>I'll bet.</s>I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.</s>So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?</s>Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?</s>Beats me.</s>
Push that button for me, will you?</s>Don't!</s>
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.</s>I'd like to discuss this.</s>This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --</s>
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.</s>Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.</s>What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]</s>A misunderstood bachelor.</s>
Thanks.</s>Anytime.</s>
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?</s>No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?</s>Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.</s>Thank you.</s>
I heard ya lady is wild.</s>No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.</s>Oh, because on our first date, she let me...</s>...no, she didn't...</s>...yes she did.</s>...I heard different, thought that was...</s>...not that time...</s>So when are you comin' to pick us up?</s>Around...</s>...too early...</s>...then what about...</s>...too late, maybe around...</s>...perfect...</s>That's what I like about you and me. We git along...</s>...like macaroni and cheese...</s>...like grits and butter...</s>...like fried and chicken...</s>
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?</s>With one of them.</s>Identify him, then. Speak to him.</s>
What's that?</s>It's a surprise.</s>
Who's that sitting in your car?</s>James Leer.</s>What's he doing out there?</s>I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.</s>
Tell us about Rachel Banks.</s>Rachel Banks?</s>
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.</s>After we've looked, we'll talk.</s>
Well, no...</s>Then that's all you had to say.</s>But</s>You always been this selfish?</s>
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?</s>It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.</s>
Well! Come on!</s>I... I...</s>
Jesus, man, can you change the station?</s>Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!</s>I've had a--</s>I pull over and kick your ass out, man!</s>--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--</s>That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!</s>
You know, I never got your name.</s>Miss Itsu.  In here, please.</s>You comin' in to hold my hand?</s>No...</s>Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.</s>
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?</s>If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.</s>
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...</s>Keep tasting...</s>
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?</s>Well... where can we go?</s>
The third store down.</s>Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.</s>
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.</s>Keep your eyes peeled.</s>What about them?</s>
I'm gonna get beside him.</s>No you're not.</s>
Oh, thank you.</s>Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.</s>You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.</s>
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?</s>Dr. Winkel.</s>
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.</s>Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?</s>What rumour?</s>That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.</s>
So, you're not a dyke.</s>Not tonight.</s>
What kind of trouble -- ?</s>Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.</s>And you got some Italians -- ?</s>Six or seven...</s>I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...</s>I understand -</s>
Yes. Yes, it does.</s>It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...</s>
Look what you did!</s>Oh my god, I'm sorry!</s>Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.</s>I can't help it, it smells so good.</s>
Done.  We go now.</s>Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.</s>
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.</s>She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.</s>Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...</s>
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.</s>Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.</s>
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.</s>Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.</s>Right.</s>
Where're you goin'?</s>To get my guns.</s>
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.</s>Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?</s>
What if we need a back up?</s>We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..</s>
-- who? -- who else is here? --</s>-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --</s>-- shut up! -- just shut the --</s>
So we can finally talk?</s>Yeah.</s>
Mikey, you look beautiful!</s>Cut it out.</s>The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.</s>
Calm down, calm down. Shh!</s>Shh.  Hide her car in the back!</s>
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --</s>What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.</s>
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.</s>Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.</s>
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.</s>Its core?</s>
Look at that:</s>First things first.</s>
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.</s>-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.</s>-- What's wrong with that?</s>Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.</s>The public decides who's on that list.</s>Please.</s>It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.</s>We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!</s>You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?</s>Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --</s>-- It's called a projector.</s>-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.</s>Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.</s>Spare me.</s>-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.</s>
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.</s>Tell me about it.</s>God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.</s>Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?</s>
Tina, you are too slick.</s>How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.</s>I've been working hard, getting paid.</s>Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?</s>Shit!  I forgot.</s>Your memory is really getting bad.</s>I just forgot.</s>
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.</s>Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.</s>That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?</s>
Yes?</s>I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.</s>
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.</s>What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"</s>Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.</s>I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.</s>Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.</s>--not fair?</s>That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...</s>--cliff-hangers--</s>I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"</s>
You get any sleep at all?</s>Some.</s>
Where are they going?</s>Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.</s>
I know who you are.</s>There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.</s>
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...</s>Isn't it, uh...</s>
Is this the wish of the masses?</s>It is their wish.</s>Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?</s>Please.</s>

They're two different things?</s>Start with what you knew then.</s>Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.</s>We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?</s>Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.</s>Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?</s>Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...</s>
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.</s>I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.</s>What're you talking about?</s>What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?</s>Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?</s>You will not hurt him?</s>Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?</s>No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.</s>You do that.</s>
And your charming little daughter?</s>Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.</s>Oh, that's such a delightful age.</s>How is gregor?</s>He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.</s>Well, where are all of you off to?</s>
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?</s>Only in passing.  To say hello to.</s>
Don't worry about him...what have you got?</s>A thing I made.</s>
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?</s>I don't know. I guess so.</s>Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.</s>
You're fishing. You don't know shit.</s>I know about Esparza.</s>

I told George I was with you last night.</s>What? Why'd you do that?</s>There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.</s>You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?</s>
Where's it headed?</s>I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.</s>
We can't touch Hoover --</s>I thought the gloves were off.</s>-- as long as he's got secret files on everybody.  I don't want 'em used against us.  What about the CIA?  Helms's done nothing for us.  I want to see him.</s>
Now get on with it.</s>We were going to do it.</s>Aye, well, now!</s>
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.</s>Where?</s>Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.</s>He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.</s>
Tell me that's not the same guy.</s>Hey ... Dick Tracy.</s>
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.</s>Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.</s>
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?</s>Dr. Homer Wells.</s>I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.</s>
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.</s>Well, it's not very plain.</s>That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?</s>But how would you find him?</s>Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?</s>Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.</s>True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.</s>
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?</s>I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.</s>
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.</s>You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.</s>
Thank you.</s>I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?</s>You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.</s>So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?</s>
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...</s>What's she talking about?</s>

Do you mind?</s>You...you can't.</s>Of course I can. I have a note from mother.</s>

Are you really going to kill them?</s>Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?</s>
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?</s>You will live.  Survive.</s>Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.</s>You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.</s>Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.</s>

I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.</s>Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.</s>I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.</s>If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --</s>

Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?</s>I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.

See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.</s>But what if the play was a hit?</s>Oh, you'd go to jail.

So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.</s>What scheme?</s>What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.</s>Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.

It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?</s>Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...</s>Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.</s>Why, why do you think that is?</s>Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?</s>Well, I don't know.</s>
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?</s>Huh?</s>It'll be all right.  We're old friends!</s>
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --</s>Transplants?</s>-- and an America's Cup Trials...</s>I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating.

The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.</s>Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.</s>
Probably okay to talk to me now.</s>Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?</s>Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....</s>

You're a cop.</s>Not exactly.</s>You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.</s>If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.</s>And what job is that?</s>My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.</s>

Well, that is a strong opinion.</s>Yes, it's unholy.</s>
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties.

Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?</s>Yeah, very big, a giant.</s>I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...</s>
Have I been a good wife?</s>Yes.</s>I want you to stop seeing her.</s>
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..</s>We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?</s>You're in violation.</s>Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.</s>
Who's that?</s>Lenny, my dispatcher.</s>
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?</s>Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.</s>

Good work, Ostreicher.</s>Thanks coach.</s>You're a killer, Ozzy!</s>-- Thanks, coach --</s>
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.</s>Why?</s>So they can have their hamburgers!</s>
Please...</s>Don't... don't do this... please...</s>
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?</s>You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.</s>I wanna play for Lonnegan.</s>You know anything about him?</s>Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.</s>
Hey.</s>Hey.</s>
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.</s>That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.</s>
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.</s>I was just playing ball.</s>You were trying to make me look bad.</s>Didn't have to try very hard.</s>
Sir.</s>Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.</s>
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?</s>I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...</s>That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?</s>I beg your pardon?</s>I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.</s>Excuse me?</s>My wedding tackle.</s>I'm sorry?</s>My meat and two veg.</s>Mr. Powers, please.

Chigro.</s>We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.</s>That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!</s>
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -</s>I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.</s>No, I -</s>
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.</s>You need ... a doctor.</s>A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.</s>
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?</s>Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...</s>We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.</s>All right then, we'll use your plan.</s>
HARRY! I found the treasure!</s>Go away, assface.</s>Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!</s>Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?</s>JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.</s>Do you hear something, Captain Rob?</s>Captain Rob came back?</s>Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.</s>Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!</s>Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.</s>Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.</s>
Father -</s>Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'</s>
Yeah?</s>You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.</s>
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.</s>Not my problem.</s>So wrong --</s>
I don't like it.</s>Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.</s>
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--</s>Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.</s>Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--</s>Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.

Wait.</s>Wait.</s>
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.</s>Yes?</s>I found it.</s>Did you see it?</s>
What are you doing here?</s>My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.</s>
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.</s>I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.</s>
Shut up.</s>What's your problem?</s>Nothing.</s>She's really getting to you, isn't she?</s>If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.</s>And that's why you're losing your bet?</s>I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.</s>Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?</s>Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.</s>

Thank God, Austin, we made it.</s>Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.</s>
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?</s>Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.</s>
What're you doing?</s>No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?</s>You're the boss.</s>
That's a very handsome sword you have there.</s>It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.</s>And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.</s>I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.</s>
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.</s>It's a Twinkie, boss.</s>
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.</s>Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?</s>Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.</s>Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --</s>That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.</s>I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?</s>Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.</s>I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.</s>Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?</s>Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?</s>It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.</s>
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.</s>Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --</s>
Are they going to torture us?</s>Yes.</s>What... whattaya do?</s>
Look, I'm sorry about the face.</s>Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?</s>Fair enough.</s>What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?</s>
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...</s>Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?</s>
King Tut's tomb....</s>Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.</s>
I'll take Columbia for twenty.</s>If his girlfriend was knocked up.</s>
Mrs. Stanwyk!</s>In a minute!</s>
Money problems?</s>Now tell him goodbye.</s>
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.</s>How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?</s>Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.</s>
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.</s>It is possible, Holiness.</s>You are unharmed?</s>Completely.</s>Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?</s>

Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.</s>Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!</s>
There is no relevant precedent.</s>Arline decision. Supreme Court.</s>Arline?</s>
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.</s>Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.</s>Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.</s>I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.</s>But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.</s>Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.</s>Yeah, I guess you are.</s>Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.</s>That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.</s>Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.</s>So what's your beef, pal?</s>Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.</s>It was you.  Downtown.</s>Eh?</s>Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.</s>No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.</s>He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.</s>All of what?</s>Of the deal, man.</s>Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.</s>But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.</s>As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.</s>In which case I'll just do what I usually do.</s>And that is?</s>What am I doing?</s>
Are you busy after work ?</s>Just trying to get my apartment in order.</s>Can I lend you a hand?</s>As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --</s>It's a fetish of mine.</s>
What do you want?</s>Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.</s>We're not proceeding anywhere together.</s>We've already begun.</s>
Robert--</s>Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.</s>
Who are you?</s>His name is...</s>I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.</s>
Well, I live downtown.</s>Yeah, I, we both live downtown.</s>
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...</s>I've got an idea.</s>I was afraid of that.</s>
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.</s>We wear black.</s>Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?</s>
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?</s>I thought I would need it.</s>And why, please tell us, would you think that?</s>After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...</s>
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.</s>There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.</s>
You went to my high-school?</s>No.</s>Then how do you know about --</s>-- You told me.</s>What are you talking about?</s>
Emily left me this morning.</s>She's left before...</s>She's left the room before. She always came back.</s>
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?</s>Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.</s>
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.</s>How about dog shit?</s>
Dead.</s>Dead?</s>Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.</s>
What the bell happened?</s>I lost them, that's what happened.</s>How did they get away?</s>They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.</s>
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.</s>Stop kidding. Wait a minute.</s>
I wouldn't do that, son.</s>They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.</s>
Hey, can you guys hear me?</s>Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!</s>Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --</s>Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.</s>
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.</s>No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.</s>
I will see what I can do.</s>I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?</s>I am strong, Paul, like a lion.</s>I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.</s>
Is that him?</s>Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.</s>
Shoot me.</s>What's it say?</s>Forty-nine point four.</s>It says forty- nine.</s>
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?</s>My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.</s>Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.</s>
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?</s>And why would she do that?</s>Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.</s>
What do you want?</s>I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.</s>
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...</s>I found the car! He's here!</s>Where?</s>Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.</s>
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.</s>You're sick.</s>And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!</s>Not a prayer.</s>I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!</s>You need help.</s>
He's dead.</s>Dead?</s>
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.</s>Like what?</s>

Who were you talking to?</s>Them.  They won't be expecting us.</s>Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.</s>Nobody can do anything right but you!</s>
Bill.</s>Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.

We know what's been going on at your office</s>Yeah, I guess you do.</s>You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.</s>Frank, I don't want to hear it.</s>Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.</s>
I can't make out that shit.</s>Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.</s>
What is it you want?</s>Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.</s>
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?</s>Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.</s>

Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.</s>What are you talking about?</s>I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.</s>
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.</s>There's always that.</s>I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?</s>I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.</s>
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...</s>So your memory's coming back?</s>Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?</s>Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?</s>No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?</s>In His name??</s>Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!</s>Really?</s>
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead.

I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?</s>
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.</s>The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.</s>
She did it.</s>We don't know that for sure.</s>Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?</s>

How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?</s>My mind's lovely.  And yours?</s>
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.</s>No, I'm not.</s>P-whipped, p-whipped.</s>What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?</s>
You don't believe in suicide.</s>It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...</s>Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.</s>Thank you, son.</s>
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.</s>We'll be waitin'.</s>
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.</s>You're doing fine.</s>I mean. I want to...</s>
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --</s>What, are you trying to get rid of me?</s>No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --</s>Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?</s>I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --</s>I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...</s>...so... is he your boyfriend now?</s>Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...</s>
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.</s>Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...</s>
Tell me about your wife...</s>My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...</s>then why did you marry her -</s>It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.</s>
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.</s>Can't remember?... What do you mean?</s>He's blanked out on that one particular point.</s>
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.</s>Story's the same, Detective...</s>
I'm not usually drunk.</s>Not usually this drunk.</s>
Yeah, this is Ronny.</s>I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.</s>
You think you could explain all this to me?</s>I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.</s>
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?</s>All right, Calloway. You win.</s>I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...</s>I said you win.</s>Win what?</s>I'll be your dumb decoy duck.</s>
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.</s>I promised Chloe we'd come here.</s>Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.</s>I'm not taking her to a bar.</s>Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.</s>
Another Martini --</s>Hello, there!</s>
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.</s>Yes.</s>Say it.</s>I was her doctor.</s>You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...</s>...I was one of a group of...</s>Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?</s>Yes.</s>You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?</s>Yes.</s>
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.</s>Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.</s>What's this? A cockaroach?</s>A spider.  Eight legs.</s>
Ninety-three miles an hour.</s>He looks wonderful, Jackson...</s>
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.</s>A short somewhere.</s>
Will you sign for the bed?</s>Sure.</s>
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.</s>Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.</s>
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.</s>If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?</s>No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.</s>He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.</s>
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.</s>Didn't take long.</s>
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.</s>Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.</s>But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.</s>
Why did you leave me?</s>I didn't leave you.</s>
I'd know him anywhere.</s>Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.</s>
Are you... are you hungry?</s>I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.</s>
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?</s>Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.</s>No spare.</s>No.</s>So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?</s>Apparently.</s>I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?</s>
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?</s>I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.</s>Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?</s>My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.</s>You really do hear a lot, don't you?</s>Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?</s>I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.</s>Still, it must be kinda rough.</s>It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.</s>
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".</s>Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.</s>
He making the drop?</s>Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.</s>What's his name?</s>Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.</s>So, when's the drop.</s>To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.</s>
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.</s>Aye, sir</s>
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?</s>Not everything. But enough to implicate us.</s>You said the worm was untreaceable!</s>Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.</s>Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!</s>No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.</s>
So what's in Paris?</s>I want to go home.</s>For twenty thousand dollars.</s>
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.</s>Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!</s>
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.</s>Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?</s>The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.</s>A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?</s>Jeff -- huh?</s>Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?</s>I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?</s>Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?</s>If possible -- both.</s>Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.</s>I can't do that.</s>I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.</s>I can't do it even if he's gone.</s>What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?</s>Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!</s>Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.</s>At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.</s>Give him evidence.</s>I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.</s>By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.</s>A detective's nightmare.</s>What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?</s>One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!</s>How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?</s>You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?</s>Ever get an answer?</s>Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"</s>
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."</s>Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!</s>
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.</s>You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.</s>
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.</s>You know where I'm from?</s>
Oh!</s>Oh, oh!</s>I feel faint.</s>Ooh.</s>
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?</s>That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".</s>
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?</s>I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.</s>
I thought you made this place ?</s>I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.</s>
Sorry...</s>It'll remind me of you.</s>Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.</s>
No thanks. You go on.</s>You sure?</s>
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.</s>All the graves?</s>I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.</s>I donut understand.</s>
I forgot where I put my keys.</s>And you thought they might be under her dress?</s>
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?</s>Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...</s>Marvellous.</s>
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.</s>You saw West, right? How was he killed?</s>Full clip to the body --</s>From up close or far away?</s>His chest was hamburger --</s>That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.</s>
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --</s>Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.</s>
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?</s>Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.</s>
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?</s>No.</s>Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?</s>No. Can I move now?</s>No. I must deactivate you.</s>For how long?</s>Indefinitely.</s>How long is that?</s>
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!</s>No...</s>
I only dog paddle.</s>Veer left. Left. Left!</s>
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?</s>Easy...</s>
Death to all vampires!</s>Maximum body-count.</s>We are awesome monster-bashers!</s>The meanest!</s>The baddest!</s>
Now that we've broken the ice...</s>I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...</s>Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.</s>But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...</s>
So, you doing anything tonight?</s>Working.</s>Hmm, how about tomorrow night?</s>Working.</s>Night after that?</s>Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.</s>I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.</s>Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'</s>
Jane?</s>Yes.</s>Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.</s>Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.</s>
What the hell do you want?</s>Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.</s>Don't call me that.</s>
Son! -- Out of the water now!</s>My boat's neat, dad!</s>I want him out of the ocean.</s>
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.</s>Don't have to tell me twice.</s>
Crocodiles! Aah!</s>The sodding water table.</s>
I didn't mean for you to go!</s>Just radio for help, okay???</s>
There's fuckin' blood all over you!</s>I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!</s>
Sir... have you a name?</s>I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.</s>
Wipe 'em out?</s>Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.</s>
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.</s>Why didn't you mention it in your letters?</s>Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.</s>
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.</s>Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.</s>
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.</s>Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?</s>Oh, no.</s>Why not?</s>I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.</s>You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.</s>It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.</s>
Which ones?  I bring them all.</s>Luminal.</s>
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.</s>We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.</s>I know a party we could go to...</s>What? Where?!</s>It's a surprise.</s>I don't believe you.</s>If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?</s>
I thought they were your friends?</s>Were, Doss <u>were</u>.</s>
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.</s>No. I want my money back right now.</s>Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...</s>See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.</s>
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!</s>Don't dramatise.</s>
Why are you doing this?</s>It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.</s>These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.</s>A year?  How'd you manage that?</s>Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.</s>
You found nothing?</s>Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.</s>No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?</s>Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...</s>
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.</s>Saxophone player?</s>What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.</s>Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.</s>What makes you so sure?</s>Just my feminine intuition.</s>
Hell. Ten?</s>And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?</s>
Rick?</s>He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.</s>Thank you very much. Good day.</s>
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.</s>I hear ya.</s>
God, you're beautiful.</s>Thank you, my love.                                         ]</s>
Yes, sir.</s>Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!</s>Yes sir.</s>Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.</s>Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.</s>One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?</s>No, sir.</s>Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.</s>The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.</s>Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?</s>No, sir.</s>
I think you better put that away.</s>I think you're right.</s>
And you believe that ?</s>I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.</s>Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?</s>This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.</s>How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?</s>What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?</s>I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.</s>
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.</s>You must be new in town.</s>I'll have me some of that punch there, too.</s>
Dr. Lester...</s>More beet-spinach juice, my friend?</s>No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.</s>I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?</s>No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...</s>And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.</s>Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.</s>The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.</s>
Don't you want me now LESLIE</s>No - I'll have you after</s>
Yes laddie, I have her.</s>Should I care?</s>
Climb up!</s>Lady Van Tassel...</s>I know.  Hold on.</s>
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.</s>What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?</s>Oh, hush up.</s>
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?</s>I don't think so.</s>You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.</s>He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.</s>You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.</s>
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....</s>At least you still have the tapes.</s>
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.</s>You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.</s>So you eat-- read it everyday?</s>Yes.</s>And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?</s>Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.</s>
What'd he say?</s>He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.</s>Why couldn't he talk about that here?</s>He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?</s>
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.</s>The what?</s>
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!</s>Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".</s>What are you talking about???</s>You know -- your plan.</s>
This is Joe White.</s>How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...</s>
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!</s>Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!</s>Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.</s>Is sex the only thing that matters to you?</s>
We crossed our own tracks.</s>He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!</s>
</s>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.</s>
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.</s>Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.</s>Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.</s>
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.</s>Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.</s>
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.</s>Coffee?</s>Yeah... No.</s>Look, if you want to leave...</s>Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!</s>
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...</s>What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!</s>Uh-huh...</s>
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?</s>A passenger...</s>
I know where you are.</s>Very good.  How did you know?</s>The pipes.</s>
Well he asked me for it!</s>I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.</s>
Here.</s>Don't DO that!!</s>Sorry.</s>What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.</s>Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.</s>I told you i'll get in trouble.</s>Pacifist!</s>I am not.</s>Bed wetter!</s>I stopped that!</s>
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...</s>What?</s>So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...</s>
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.</s>Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.</s>
There she is!</s>Which one?</s>
You all put together?</s>My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?</s>There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?</s>You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?</s>The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.</s>That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?</s>There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?</s>The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.</s>Late for what?</s>Don't be dense. The party.</s>I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.</s>Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...</s>
California...</s>Live there?</s>Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.</s>You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.</s>I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--</s>It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.</s>Wait a second--</s>Ah, I can smell it on you.</s>
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.</s>Did you like it, then?</s>How could I not?</s>It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?</s>
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?</s>At your house. Don't you remember?</s>No. No, I don't.</s>We just killed a couple of people...</s>What?</s>
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.</s>Now we're talking.</s>
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.</s>I won't.  Goodnight.</s>'Night.</s>
We aren't completely stupid.</s>Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --</s>
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.</s>I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.</s>I'm responsible for public safety around here...</s>
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.</s>What was it, Mr. Hillyer?</s>Nothing, Rose.</s>
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?</s>That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?</s>To protect his people.</s>I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.</s>Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.</s>John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.</s>
Let's let your tuchus breathe.</s>Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?</s>
It's already started, Dad... with me.</s>I know.</s>And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --</s>
Well, look er, I ...</s>What is your name, handsome knight?</s>Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.</s>Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.</s>
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?</s>In a week... we will never have had this conversation.</s>
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—</s>Shut up!</s>
Guess they're up.</s>Sounds big.  What's he do?</s>Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.</s>What happened to the donut king?</s>Married.</s>
What's a'matter?</s>Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.</s>How much?</s>$20.</s>Let's go to the movies...on you.</s>
What...does it turn to?</s>It turns to steaming piss.</s>
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?</s>No...</s>
Do you have any theories about last night?</s>Theories?</s>How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -</s>
What's up?</s>No questions.</s>I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.</s>Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.</s>How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?</s>
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?</s>How did you know?!</s>I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?</s>1899.</s>I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?</s>What are you?</s>I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.</s>I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --</s>An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...</s>
You didn't tell us you were coming?</s>Then how did you know?</s>
What's he talking about?</s>One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...</s>
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.</s>You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.</s>Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.</s>
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?</s>Huh?</s>I can read it to you.</s>You mean, again?</s>Well, I changed the ending a little.</s>Oh. What happens now?</s>Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.</s>Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.</s>But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.</s>I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.</s>
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.</s>If I go to jail...?</s>I'll knit you a sweater.</s>
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!</s>Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.</s>
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes.

[Beat] I've been to his grave.</s>[Beat] What?</s>His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...</s>
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.</s>I am a suicide risk.</s>Is this Juno?</s>No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?</s>Only the one in my pants.</s>Dude, I'm pregnant.</s>Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?</s>It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.</s>How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?</s>I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.</s>Is this for real? Like for real, for real?</s>Unfortunately, yes.</s>Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!</s>That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.</s>Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.</s>I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.</s>Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.</s>Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.</s>
I need your clothes, Byers.</s>Me?</s>
--- What was that?</s>I didn't hear anything.</s>
Hi, beautiful.</s>Jesus!  Don't do that!</s>Sorry, babe.</s>
How long do you live?  I mean, last?</s>A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.</s>
Open up! We hear you got a riot.</s>Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?</s>Deputy sheriffs.</s>Got a warrant?</s>We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.</s>Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.</s>
You got it.</s>We work fast enough for you?</s>
Who's it for? A relative?</s>Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.</s>Ten thousand sounds high.</s>They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.</s>
Where'd you spend last night?</s>With Trina.</s>I called Trina.</s>Maybe I wasn't there when you called.</s>Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.</s>How do you know how bad it was?</s>Why couldn't you stay here with me?</s>Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!</s>
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?</s>I did!</s>No you didn't!</s>Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!</s>
But why? She's the best friend I've got.</s>She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.</s>Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.</s>What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.</s>I won't let you say that!</s>Well, I do say it.</s>She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--</s>Don't kid yourself -- she means it.</s>Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?</s>I'm not quarreling, only ...</s>
Are you here?</s>I'm here.</s>Because you don't really seem here.</s>I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!</s>Something's up wi...</s>You think I didn't get that?</s>
What's wrong?</s>Nothing could be better...</s>
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?</s>Fine.</s>
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.</s>Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.</s>He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.</s>Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.</s>All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.</s>You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.</s>
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.</s>Can we get to him?</s>No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.</s>
We got it second-hand.</s>All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?</s>
Don't know.</s>Dominick said they're in the motel?</s>Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.</s>
You sure it was him?</s>Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.</s>I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.</s>We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.</s>I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.</s>
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?</s>You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?</s>Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?</s>Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?</s>I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.</s>A little?</s>Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.</s>You gonna forget about the money I owe you?</s>What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.</s>
Will you take me back to my grandparents?</s>Of course.</s>
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -</s>Luck.  The right place at the right time.</s>Really.  I'd like to speak with him.</s>I don't think I'll be running into him.</s>You never know.  Go get some sleep.</s>I'll try. Thanks.</s>
You have a strong unfufilled desire.</s>Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.</s>No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.</s>The band.</s>
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!</s>And they might believe her in Moscow.</s>What do you mean they might -- they will!</s>
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.</s>She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.</s>
I don't know any Rwandans.</s>You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.</s>Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...</s>Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.</s>
Coffee's perked.</s>When did she die?</s>Is...? She's dead then?</s>
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?</s>No.</s>
Never heard of him.</s>Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.</s>The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?</s>
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.</s>Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!</s>
Oh, that is disgusting.</s>Murderer!</s>
Very few, if any.</s>Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?</s>For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.</s>Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.</s>
Wow.  Who's that for?</s>Well.  It's for you.</s>
Same thing from Fish And Game.</s><u>Something's</u> in that water.</s>Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.</s>
Hey look, it's our teacher.</s>Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.</s>
Can they be killed?</s>These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.</s>
What?</s>You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?</s>No.</s>I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.</s>
Bad?</s>Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.</s>I'll see you in a minute.</s>
Off the record. No cameras.</s>Forget it.</s>
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!</s>Oh, let me go, will you!</s>Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!</s>
This is funny.</s>Yeah.</s>I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.</s>Ok.</s>Alright?</s>....Hi.....</s>....Hi.....</s>
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.</s>Happy as can be. In the old groove.</s>
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.</s>Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?</s>Well, I guess it's a chance.</s>Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--</s>I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!</s>Wait--</s>What you *have* to do is fight!</s>But--I've done everything I--</s>I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!</s>Oh--Saunders--</s>Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--</s>Saunders--if there was *any* way--</s>We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!</s>
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?</s>Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.</s>
How's the patient.</s>Awaiting his arrival.</s>What about the cat?</s>Completely unaware.</s>
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.</s>And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.</s>
Working late?  I'm touched.</s>No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --</s>
I hope you're right.  I really do.</s>I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.</s>
You want somethin'?</s>No, I'm okay.</s>
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?</s>Okay.</s>
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?</s>Hmm... Mike and Ike's.</s>Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.

I don't want any trouble.</s>Oh, come on, just a little.</s>I'm ready to make you another deal.</s>Ooh, be still, my heart.</s>See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.</s>
So?</s>So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.</s>What are you talking about?</s>That's what I want to know.</s>
Where is he?!!</s>I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!</s>

Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.</s>A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.</s>
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?</s>I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.</s>I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.</s>I hear good things about the new play.</s>So do I. Over and over.</s>Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.</s>Would you like to meet him?</s>He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.</s>I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.</s>The fact is, I have to get going.</s>Is it true?</s>Is what true?</s>He wears a disguise.</s>Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.</s>But you're his friend.</s>Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.</s>
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.</s>I though Freddy was just an old town story.</s>It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.</s>
You know, for when you travel.</s>For when I travel?</s>
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.</s>You1re leaving, too?</s>I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.</s>
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...</s>Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.</s>What are you doing here?</s>Screaming</s>Besides that.</s>He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.</s>The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?</s>The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.</s>I'd better get you down.</s>
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?</s>Temporarily?  Uh...sure....</s>
Hello.</s>How are you?</s>All right, son.</s>
I don't have kids.</s>You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.</s>
You mind? I'm eating, huh?</s>Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?</s>I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.</s>Used you?</s>I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.</s>What the hell is that supposed to mean?</s>It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.</s>War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.</s>I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?</s>
Sanchez...?</s>I'm here.</s>You treat her nice.</s>...What are you talking about...?</s>Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.</s>...Have you been drinking?</s>Not yet.</s>
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.</s>That's what was estimated.</s>Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.</s>
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.</s>I can go to the bar.</s>Don't leave me.</s>Those guys bother you?</s>No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.</s>
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.</s>Am I free to go?</s>You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.</s>I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --</s>Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.</s>Jon??  You mean he's --</s>That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.</s>
Do you mind if I sit?</s>Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...</s>I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.</s>Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.</s>
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?</s>No.</s>Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?</s>Yes.</s>
Scarecrow?</s>Yeah?</s>

What's he saying now?</s>Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.</s>Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.</s>That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...</s>What?</s>That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.</s>DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?</s>'82.</s>Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?</s>I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.</s>This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?</s>
Come on!</s>He's dead.</s>
Where's the air conditioning?</s>I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.</s></s>
Crimefighter's rule number two.</s>I'm afraid to ask.</s>Be ready for anything.</s>
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?</s>Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.</s>I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.</s>When you were a little French girl?</s>Oui.</s>That would be good.</s>
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane...

Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?</s>I'm kind of busy, Norma.</s>You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.</s>
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...</s><u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.</s>
Dr. Pemberton?</s>Yes!</s>
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.</s>As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.</s>Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.</s>
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.</s>Maybe this'll jog your memory.</s>
Mr. Clear Moon.</s>Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.</s>
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...</s>Oh Christ!</s>
Who are you?  The undertaker?</s>Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.</s>Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?</s>Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.</s>

The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!</s>What doors?</s>I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --</s>You said the system couldn't fail!</s>
What's the gun for, General Ripper?</s>Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.</s>Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?</s>That's right, Major.</s>

Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?</s>Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?</s>Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there.

It's still on.</s>What?</s>His camera... it's still recording.</s>
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.</s>Man, it's already ten thirty.</s>
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.</s>Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?</s>Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.</s>Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."</s>Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!</s>
Of course. Aunt Joan.</s>And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.</s>I've thought about you.</s>

All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.</s>No! You can't! They're in on it.</s>I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.</s>
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.</s>Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.</s>
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?</s>I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.</s>
Here. Take your fifty cents back.</s>That's all right.</s>No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.</s>
By letting me help you.</s>Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?</s>Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.</s>Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.</s>Oh, tut, tut, tut.</s>I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.</s>Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .</s>
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?</s>Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.</s>
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.</s>Ah, love again.</s>But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?</s>I have no idea.</s>Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.</s>Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!</s>Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.</s>
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.</s>Nothing worse than a common tool.</s>
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.</s>That'd be great.</s>Well -- take care.</s>
Crossed over?</s>But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.</s>
When is mommy coming back?</s>Soon.  I told you before, very soon.</s>Will she pick me up after school?</s>No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.</s>What if she forgets?</s>I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.</s>
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?</s>It wouldn't come.</s>
I have felt him, my Master.</s>Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.</s>
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.</s>Okay.</s>If not for me, at least for Amy.</s>Okay, okay.</s>You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.</s>I don't need one.</s>Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.</s>That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.</s>Yes, I - yes, I do.</s>No, you don't.</s>How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.</s>Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.</s>
Tell me more. I want to know everything.</s>There isn't any more to tell.</s>Don't say that.</s>No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.</s>Well, it's enough for me.</s>You don't have to say that.</s>I never say anything I have to.</s>I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.</s>What are we about to do?</s>Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...</s>I don't drink coffee...</s>... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...</s>I don't drink coffee...</s>And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..</s>
What does that mean?</s>It's a problem in celestial mechanics.</s>Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.</s>He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.</s>
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.</s>-- C'mon, Stephen.</s>-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.</s>
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -</s>Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -</s>
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?</s>The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.</s>The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?</s>Uh, I don't know.</s>Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.</s>
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!</s>My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?</s>Supposing she's an assassin?</s>Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?</s>
Or this -- is this a significant difference?</s>No it is not, Mr. Dowd.</s>

Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.</s>Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.</s>I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.</s>Your partner?</s>I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.</s>
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?</s>Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!</s>

I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?</s>

Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.</s>Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.</s>
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!</s>Fuck you.</s>We already played that game. You lost, remember?</s>
Yeah.</s>Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?</s>Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.</s>Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.</s>Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.</s>
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.</s>And I suppose you don't feel bad!</s>

Hypnos?</s>Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.</s>
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.</s>I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.</s>I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.</s>George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.</s>So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.</s>
I know you said you didn't want any calls...</s>That's right I did, didn't I?</s>Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy.

Don't do it!</s>Just give me the keys.</s>Whatever it is, don't do it.</s>
Yes, Hannah?</s>I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.</s>

I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.</s>No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.</s>

Now, where were we?</s>You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.</s>Why not?</s>Because it just isn't a business, that's all!</s>Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.</s>
Where is she staying?</s>Where are you staying?</s>
What have they told you?</s>So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?</s>I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.</s>Shit.</s>But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?</s>Sure.</s>

He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.</s>My God...</s>He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us.

Ask me when we get home.</s>Oh, my <u>program</u>...</s>
Any sign of Santa?</s>He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.</s>
Hard to believe.</s>Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?</s>
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.</s>Me? What'd I do?</s>Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew.

But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?</s>May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire.

Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.</s>Nah uh.</s>
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?</s>No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.</s>We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?</s>Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.</s>If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?</s>Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.</s>Have you requested re-enforcements?</s>Yes we have.</s>What was the response?</s>We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.</s>
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life.

I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?</s>Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?</s>No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.</s>You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?</s>No.</s>Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.</s>

She's an amateur, just like Del was.</s>

I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.</s>Whet do you mean?</s>They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning.

Maybe we should just end this right here.</s>Fine with me.</s>I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.</s>See you in the next world.</s>I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.</s>Fine.</s>I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?</s>Yes.

I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.</s>Can I get you anything?</s>Maybe a brandy.</s>Sure.</s>I'll be down in a minute</s>O.K.</s>
Who did that? What the fuck is that?</s>It's going back down.</s>Applejack! What's happening?</s>
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.</s>Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?</s>Fascinated.</s>I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.</s>
This is not a place you wanna go.</s>Let go of my hand.</s>
Have we met before?</s>No.</s>Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,</s>Well, you didn't forget me.

You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.</s>Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.</s>
I like my life.  I'm a free man.</s>Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.</s>
Now I have -- it's a long story.</s>Why didn't you just shoot them?</s>Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.</s>You're going to let them get away with this?</s>We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.</s>They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?</s>So far they're keeping their part of it.</s>They put their hands all over me.</s>Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.

Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...</s>I'll never get over it.</s>Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.</s>I wish I could believe that.</s>Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented...  ... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do-</s>

Tell them about Pauline's mum.</s>Not now. They wouldn't believe me.</s>
He didn't make it.</s>Huh?</s>Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.</s>I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.</s>I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?</s>Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...</s>Yeah? What do I do then?</s>I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.</s>
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.</s>This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.</s>

It's safe?</s>It's safe.</s>It's safe.</s>Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?</s>Alright.</s>
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.</s>So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.</s>Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.</s>Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?</s>Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.</s>Use 'em and lose 'em.</s>Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.</s>What about the husbands?</s>Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?</s>Those idiots.</s>

Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.</s>What do you do?</s>I'm a professor.

I find women charming.</s>I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.</s>What you don't know about women is a lot.</s>
Find it?</s>Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.</s>
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.</s>Hello, Vi.</s>
Somebody did that to him.</s>I think he did it to himself.</s>
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.</s>Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.</s>Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --</s>Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.</s>I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!</s>
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.</s>What does he mean by "target audience"?</s>
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.</s>I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.</s>
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.</s>Honey. I just can't.</s>Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.</s>Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.</s>It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.</s>
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.</s>Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.</s>Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.</s>
It's about to be a broken face.</s>This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.</s>
Don't you want to walk, Tom?</s>No.</s>Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.</s>
...don't talk.</s>It's pleasant down that way, too.</s>
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.</s>Thank you.</s>It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.</s>And to history.</s>
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...</s>Where’s my real dad?</s>I don’t know...</s>
Who ????</s>Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --</s>No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --</s>
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?</s>Over here.</s>
I'm reportin' this to my union!!</s><u>What</u> union?</s>The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!</s>
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.</s>It's started.</s>
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.</s>Why didn't you say anything?</s>I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's</s>
Well.</s>Benjamin.</s>Yes?</s>I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?</s>Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.</s>Why don't you watch?</s>Oh -- sure. Thank you.</s>
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.</s>You said.</s>Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."</s>
One minute but then--</s>--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?</s>
Was that all?</s>This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.</s>
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.</s>You have it?</s>Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.</s>Who?</s>Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.</s>Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...</s>Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...</s>
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.</s>A ring.  I wanted a ring.</s>You did?</s>
Joely...</s>Yeah, Tangerine?</s>Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?</s>No.</s>It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."</s>
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.</s>Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.</s>
Is there a young Tim?</s>No.</s>Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"</s>
Big piece or little?</s>Huh? Oh, no.</s>None?</s>I'm not much for sweets.</s>
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?</s>Frightened.</s>Do you remember what just happened?</s>Yes.</s>That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?</s>Yes.</s>
Got another gun and a stun gun...</s>And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.</s>What do you do when he comes home?</s>Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.</s>You do that?</s>That's my job.</s>Did you do it that night?</s>He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.</s>And is that it?</s>More or less.</s>
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?</s>Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.</s>
Really?</s>From a rich millionaire.</s>That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.</s>Me?</s>Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.</s>
I hear you're not enjoying it here.</s>I could take it or leave it.</s>
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?</s>Brody?  This is Patrol Base.</s>
The door needs a lock.</s>Sure.  I'll fix it right away.</s>
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.</s>We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.</s>Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.</s>I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.</s>Oh, I'll represent alright.</s>
This is Barry.</s>Hey it's me, what are you doing?</s>Hello, Karen. I'm just working.</s>Yeah but what are you doing?</s>I'm just working....I have some customers here.....</s>So you can't talk to me?</s>I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.</s>"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"</s>Well, I can't talk though --</s>You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.</s>Yes, I'll be there.</s>Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.</s>Ok, bye-bye.</s>
Is there a problem, George?</s>No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!</s>
So, like, where is she?</s>Yeah, really.</s>
Anything I can help you with?</s>Well I just uh, you know...</s>
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?</s>Got it Earl.</s>Okay, out.</s>
Where are you going?</s>The library. I'll be fine.</s>
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.</s>It's only one picture deal.</s>So few come back...</s>Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...</s>
She'd be about thirteen now...</s>We got two around that age...</s>Where?</s>You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...</s>But couldn't you...?</s>Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!</s>
Good morning.</s>Morning.</s>I wonder if you could help me.</s>Try my best.</s>I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.</s>Yep.</s>
Hey, Sweden!!!</s>They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --</s>
Oh, thank you very much.</s>Thank you.</s>Well, how's it going back there?</s>
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.</s>So you never knew your mother?</s>I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.</s>I'm sorry.</s>Yeah. [Beat] How about you?</s>Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.</s>How?</s>She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.</s>
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.</s>Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.</s>
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.</s>Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.</s>
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.</s>I guess there's probably a story behind that.</s>There is, but it's not that interesting.</s>So where have you been staying?</s>The bus station.</s>
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.</s>How'd you happen to miss?</s>They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.</s>Good thing you didn't.</s>
Tank, you're hurt.</s>I'll be all right.</s>Dozer?</s>
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...</s>Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.</s>
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.</s>He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.</s>I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.</s>We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.</s>
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.</s>I'd be able to see something.</s>
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.</s>I can see why.</s>She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!</s>
Wheelchair accessible.</s>Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.</s>
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.</s>Looks like Tim Kobza.</s>
Don't make do it, Mike.</s>Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?</s>I won't get away with it.</s>Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.</s>
This one , Lance?</s>Yeah, Jesus Christ !</s>
Oh my God.  What happened?</s>The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.</s>
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.</s>Used to Filmore, used to.</s>
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.</s>I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --</s>Uh-huh.</s>Does this sound weird?</s>Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.</s>There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.</s>What kind of Cancer?</s>Brain and Lung.</s>My mother had breast cancer.</s>It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?</s>Oh, she's fine.</s>Oh that's good.</s>It was scary though.</s>It's a helluva disease.</s>Sure is.  So why call me?</s>
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--</s>--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--</s>
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.</s>But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--</s>Waldos.</s>Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.</s>
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?</s>I'm fine.</s>
What happened to your hand?</s>I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.</s>Got any requests?</s>That country shit all sounds the same to me.</s>How about I pick one out for you?</s>
You straight?</s>Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?</s>
Do you need a break?</s>No.</s>While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?</s>That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.</s>Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?</s>No.</s>Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?</s>
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?</s>No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.</s>Who was the architect?</s>He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.</s>
We had a deal!</s>Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.</s>
I told you you could do it.</s>I was like a different person tonight.</s>You were the new and improved you.</s>I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.</s>No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.</s>It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.</s>You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.</s>Really? You'd do that for me?</s>I've been very lazy for a long, long time.</s>You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.</s>I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.</s>My parents always say hard work builds character.</s>It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.</s>What kind of ideas?</s>Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."</s>You think we should be more open minded?</s>The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.</s>In other words, our scope is too narrow.</s>At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.</s>That's perfect.</s>
What was his name?</s>Donnie. Donnie Darko.</s>
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.</s>Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?</s>
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?</s>That smell's still fillin' this room good.</s>Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.</s>And Bobby too, I hear...</s>Yeah... He was lookin' for you.</s>You talk to 'im some?...</s>Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.</s>Oughta make 'em happy.</s>So where'd you say you was?</s>Went with Bobby.</s>
What did you do to him?</s>Nothing.</s>
You booger.</s>That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.</s>
I'm nearly out.</s>It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.</s>Thank you, Bobby. A big score?</s>Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.</s>Don't be late.</s>
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.</s>I know. He told me.</s>What?! He told you? When?</s>
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.</s>Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.</s>
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.</s>I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.</s>
What's that?</s>It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!</s>
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.</s>Long ago.</s>Not so long.</s>Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.</s>I see more than what you are.</s>
What about Leia and the Wookiee?</s>You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.</s>That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.</s>I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.</s>No.</s>Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.</s>
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.</s>See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.</s>
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.</s>I want to cut his throat.</s>It's already been cut.</s>Then I'll cut his balls off.</s>
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?</s>Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.</s>And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?</s>
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --</s>-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.</s>If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?</s>Not necessarily.</s>Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.</s>Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.</s>Who are you trying to convince?</s>
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.</s>He's not finished.</s>
You saved my life.</s>I had to.</s>Thanks.</s>I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.</s>
It's beautiful...</s>Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.</s>
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.</s>He killed a police officer.</s>
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.</s>Please.</s>
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -</s>That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!</s>
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.</s>That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.</s>
No comment.</s>Don't you see how silly you're being?</s>Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?</s>
Thank you.</s>You're welcome.</s>
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!</s>Oh --</s>
Hey, bro.</s>It's Case. Remember me?</s>
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?</s>I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.</s>
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.</s>Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.</s>
Edward, did you hear me?</s>I'm here.</s>I know a lot of nice girls.</s>
Excuse me, do you have...</s>To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?</s>
Let's go.</s>She's not very nice, is she?</s>
What's going on?</s>Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.</s>
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.</s>I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.</s>No.  But someone you can talk to.</s>
Qual se tu?</s>It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.</s>It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.</s>Magnificent. You are the first to find me.</s>We sought only your infinite wisdom.</s>And how did you breach the Barrier?</s>With a starship!</s>This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?</s>It could. Yes.</s>Then I shall make use of this starship.</s>It will be your chariot!</s>
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.</s>Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!</s>No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?</s>
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.</s>I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.</s>Must we again hear these heretical rantings?</s>
What are you lookin' for?</s>Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?</s>ok.</s>You just move in here?</s>About two years ago.</s>Bit messy.</s>Yeah.</s>I'm a bit of a slob myself.</s>Yeah.</s>You and your boyfriend have a party last night?</s>I don't have a boyfriend.</s>
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...</s>Like where--in your dreams?</s>
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?</s>I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.</s>We can't shoot the Old Mill.</s>You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...</s>
She okay?</s>I hope so.</s>
Oh, Lydia!</s>Lydia.  Lydia what?</s>God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.</s>No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...</s>
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.</s>I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.</s>You should feel like shit.</s>I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?</s>Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.</s>I'm on her.</s>
He is!</s>Look, it's important.</s>
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?</s>Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.</s>Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?</s>With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.</s>I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.</s>We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.</s>This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.</s>
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?</s>No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?</s>Eight o'clock?</s>What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --</s>Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?</s>No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --</s>Billingsley's?</s>Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?</s>It's my favorite place --</s>Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.</s>Great, bye.</s>Bye.</s>
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?</s>Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.</s>
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!</s>You're about an inch away from insubordination!</s>Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?</s>Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.</s>
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"</s>I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.</s>
There was no sperm.</s>The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.</s>What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.</s>What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.</s>Would you step outside, Sergeant?</s>
Yes.</s>There are only ten.</s>
Serving with you has been an honor.</s>The honor was mine. Captain Riker.</s>
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.</s>Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?</s>The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.</s>Can you finish on schedule?</s>In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.</s>
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.</s>Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.</s>Mm.</s>You're going back?</s>Mm.</s>
You ought to put a bandage on that.</s>No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.</s>
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.</s>You can get out of the dinner.</s>No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.</s>Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.</s>
How'd you do that?</s>Must've been a defective puck.</s>
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?</s>I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.</s>Eliminate the competition.</s>You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.</s>
ML stands for ML.  That's it.</s>Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.</s>Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.</s>
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.</s>We're taking the other case.</s>What other case?</s>Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.</s>
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.</s>...that's all right.</s>I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.</s>
So you're still on the Zoloft?</s>Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.</s>
I am sorry, Lhamo.</s>It is alright, Father.</s>
But, you do come from a military family?</s>I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.</s>
Now you know what I know.</s>Sir?</s>
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.</s>Mother.  She's beautiful.</s>Well, yes, that she was.  She certainly made this place a home.</s>
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.</s>I'd like to know.  I'll go along.</s>No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.</s>

Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?</s>What’s your business with Elektra King?</s>I thought you were the one in her business.</s>She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?</s>As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.</s>
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.</s>They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.</s>

But you haven't put in for emigration.</s>Nope.</s>You're going to be over the limit.</s>Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.</s>What if you change your mind?</s>They'll change the limit before I change my mind.</s>You sure?</s>Never been more sure of anything in my life.</s>
What is it you want from me?</s>Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.</s>I'm a great believer in doing nothing.</s>So we understand each other?</s>Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.</s>

Look at all that <u>parking</u>!</s>Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.</s>
Have a good trip.</s>Sleep tight, sweetie.</s>
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.</s>What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?</s>
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?</s>To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.</s>
All done.</s>Honey this is Father Dyer.</s>Hi Father.</s>
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.</s>What's the decoy?</s>Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?</s>Shoot!</s>
You want to do this some other time?</s>Pull your pants down.</s>I'm sorry?</s>Pull your motherfucking pants down.</s>
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?</s>I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.</s>Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.</s>Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.</s>Just a favor for your old man.</s>Sure, Dad.</s>
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.</s>Business is good at the hotel?</s>Very good.</s>I am always glad to see you Paul.</s>
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.</s>When the lock is broken -- yes.</s>
So there never was a death squad.</s>Naawww.</s>Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.</s>Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.</s>
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.</s>It's gone too far.</s>Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer...

What was this desperate urge to see me?</s>All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.</s>Well, I detected an undercurrent.</s>I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.</s>Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?</s>Oh... this and that.</s>What I've been doing?</s>If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.</s>Naturally.</s>
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.</s>How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.</s>Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.</s>We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.</s>Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.</s>You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.</s>If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.</s>
How many bullets?</s>Three bullets -- minimum.</s>No way. No fucking way!</s>I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move.

Nice to feel needed.</s>Let's move out!</s>Yes!</s>
Let me get that for you.</s>Oh please. I can't have you do that.</s>It's the least I can do.</s>
Yo son, check this out.</s>Dog, you look hot.</s>
Something wrong?</s>I'm a little dizzy...</s>
And so will we.</s>Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?</s>Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.</s>You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.</s>
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?</s>Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.</s>
Please.  It won't happen again.</s>No, thank you.  I'll walk.</s>
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?</s>How are you, Jane?</s>Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?</s>No.</s>Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.</s>Good.</s>Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?</s>
Where's Timmy and Buck?</s>Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?</s>You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?</s>That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.</s>Oh sure, Fred.</s>
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?</s>That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.</s>Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?</s>You bet.  Did you like it?</s>
It's because he comes off as the underdog.</s>Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.</s>You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.</s>
What is that?</s>Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...</s>What, like a girdle?</s>Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.</s>Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...</s>That's the spirit!</s>I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!</s>Really?</s>Never...</s>I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.</s>I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.</s>Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.</s>Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...</s>Oh yeah?</s>Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.</s>Why?</s>Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?</s>I won't even dignify that with a response.</s>
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?</s>I think he's dead!</s>Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.</s>
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.</s>Why did you come here, Grady?</s>
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.</s>That's not wh...</s>You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?</s>You weren't passing 'em out.</s>Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.</s>
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.</s>Actually we have something for you.</s>
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!</s>Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?</s>Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!</s>
Are you going to the reunion?</s>No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?</s>That's part of it.</s>Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...</s>It's always the little things.</s>Yep.</s>
What did they do with you?</s>They booted me out of Washington.</s>Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.</s>Why?  What did they do to you?</s>
I did see them. I did.</s>He's the worst liar.</s>
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.</s>Goddammit!  That's outrageous.</s>
Got it.</s>I need the main wet-wall.</s>
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.</s>She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!</s>
A girl...?</s>It's too soon to know.</s>
Whatís the problem.</s>Connection denied.</s>Try it again.</s>Itís not working.</s>Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?</s>I always check the batteries.</s>Run it through from the top.</s>
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.</s>What stinks so bad?</s>Our friend, the shark.</s>
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?</s>Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --</s>
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.</s>On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.</s>
That's the call that I'm waiting for.</s>What does it mean?</s>They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.</s>Does that mean I'm back for awhile?</s>
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.</s>Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.</s>
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?</s>Why, you... you little bastard!</s>
Hi Buddy.</s>Open chest!!!</s>
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.</s>I could take after Dad, too.</s>You do. You're handsome and charming.</s>I meant he's a doctor.</s>That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.</s>I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.</s>That'd be something.</s>
George --</s>Keep moving --</s>Now, George --</s>Nobody's gonna get you but me!</s>
Steady on course. All systems normal.</s>It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?</s>
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.</s>Father, I have nowhere else to stay.</s>You have a sister in New Orleans.</s>
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...</s>Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.</s>I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.</s>No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...</s>
How do you feel, DeJesus?</s>Okay.</s>Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.</s>
They had a pattern to follow...</s>... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.</s>Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.</s>
Oh. Of course... sorry.</s>My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?</s>Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?</s>Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...</s>I have... did it sound that bad?</s>Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...</s>George...</s>...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...</s>Thanks...</s>...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.</s>
But I can't can I?</s>No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.</s>
She's mad.</s>No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.</s>Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...</s>
Oh, why are you making those faces?</s>I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--</s>Listen, you are witnessing genius!</s>I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.</s>Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!</s>
Who was that man?</s>It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?</s>It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.</s>
I'm an English major.  You like English?</s>Sort of.</s>Careful.</s>Huh?</s>That was two words.</s>

That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?</s>Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.</s>The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.</s>
You dumb jarhead motherf--</s>Chill out, Lindsey!!</s>
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.</s>Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.</s>
Is there a picture of her somewhere?</s>No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?</s>No.</s>Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?</s>No, you couldn't.</s>I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.</s>Really?</s>Yeah. You should check downstairs.</s>Why?</s>People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.</s>
I don't know what the big deal is.</s>You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.</s>
Smells like sex in here.</s>Thumper had a busy afternoon.</s>You're kidding. He's so... big.</s>
I'll do everything in my power --</s>Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.</s>
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.</s>I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?</s>

What's that? A hundred?</s>That's right, Harry.</s>Your hundred, and another hundred.</s>
Don't you think you're overreacting?</s>Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.</s>...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.</s>What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?</s>Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.</s>That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.</s>I know what I saw -</s>
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?</s>Huh?</s>After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.</s>
Honk at him. Scare him.</s>He won't move.</s>
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?</s>Yup.</s>Hmmmm. Interesting.

How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."</s>Who said that?</s>Why, that's from Time Magazine.</s>No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.</s>Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?</s>
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...</s>Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.</s>

Her doctors murdered her.</s>Do you know who her doctors were?</s>I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.</s>The most respected...</s>Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?</s>
Hi, Gale, any leads?</s>Tons and tons.</s>Where is Sidney's father?</s>Home--where he lives.</s>And are the police sure about that?</s>Why don't you ask them?</s>Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?</s>No, I don't.</s>Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.</s>Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.</s>
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?</s>Yes.</s>Do you believe me?</s>Yes.</s>You damn well better. Go.</s>
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.</s>Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.</s>I'd love that.</s>Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.</s>Mr. Thomerson, I...</s>Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...</s>Feel free.</s>First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...</s>
Ed, how're you holding up?</s>I'm OK, Walter, thanks.</s>
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.</s>This isn't a game, you know.</s>
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.</s>And then...</s>
Can I ask you a personal question?</s>Of course! That's exactly what I want.</s>Have you thought about getting a wife?</s>
Hey, Halberstam?</s>Yes, Owen?</s>Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?</s>No, Owen.</s>Is that a raincoat?</s>Yes, it is.</s>
She's right.</s>Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.</s>I'm going home.</s>
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.</s>Where's Warner?</s>

It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.</s>Stop acting like a silly little fag!</s>
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.</s>Two years ago? Sorry.</s>They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?</s>Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.</s>
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.</s>Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.</s>Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?</s>Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.</s>
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.</s>Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.</s>
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?</s>Get out of my facial.</s>
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?</s>You got no idea...</s>Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.</s>
How do we do this, then?</s>We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...</s>Do you love me, Rose?</s>
Hello?</s>Hey, it's me.</s>Phreak?</s>I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.</s>You think they're going to bust us?</s>Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?</s>
Are you all right?</s>Now look what you've done.</s>
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....</s>We forgot to stop at the store.</s>
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?</s>It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.</s>Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?</s>What do you think?</s>I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.</s>
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.</s>I'll get Ida to make up your bed.</s>
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.</s>We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.</s>
Be careful.</s>Of course, I'll be careful.</s>
Push and twist, it's child proof.</s>Oh.</s>Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.</s>
Is it an ongoing case?</s>For months... last October.</s>It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.</s>How do you know that?</s>He felt remorse.  He covered her.</s>
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?</s>Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?</s>No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...</s>
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...</s>Just gimme the damn remote!</s>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</s>
Had enough?</s>Even the alarm didn't wake him.</s>
You share a place with T-Bone?</s>No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.</s>I understand completely.</s>
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.</s>It's fine.</s>
He's going to be in jail for a long time.</s>Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.</s>
You won't be long?</s>I'll join you shortly.</s>
Drive for a minute.</s>Where you going?!</s>
Did he...?</s>Yep.</s>
Spit it out.</s>MY girlfriend's pregnant.</s>
What're you going to do?</s>I'm going to tell him the truth.</s>Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?</s>I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.</s>You're crazy! You can't do that!</s>
Eeeww!</s>I know. I don't understand it either.</s>
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!</s>Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?</s>You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.</s>A Toon?  Noooo.</s>Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.</s>Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.</s>Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.</s>Safe?</s>Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.</s>
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.</s>Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.</s>
Doesn't your foot hurt?</s>I can't feel a thing, Hon.</s>
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?</s>Um, hi?</s>Leah just told me you were going with her.</s>Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.</s>
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -</s>Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.</s>OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.</s>Thank you very much, Clarence.</s>You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.</s>I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.</s>Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.</s>
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.</s>I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.</s>

Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.</s>Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.</s>
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.</s>You enjoy it?</s>Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.</s>Tell me what happened.</s>What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...</s>Nobody saw you bring her in?</s>There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.</s>What did you do with her body?</s>Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.</s>Show me.</s>
Oh, Jesus....</s>Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --</s>
Don't you ever get bored around here?</s>Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.</s>
Rain's coming.</s>Thank God.</s>
Where IS the conference?</s>She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.</s>
My friend, you always surprise me.</s>We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...</s>
What are you talking about?</s>According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.</s>I didn't do that!</s>You said you were here all day?</s>Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!</s>An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.</s>But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!</s>
You heard about Carlton Fraser?</s>Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?</s>
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.</s>Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...</s>

Worked like a charm.</s>Jesus.</s>
Yes.</s>You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?</s>No.  But...</s>But what?</s>Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.</s>What's that?</s>"It's a Wonderful Life."</s>The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?</s>"It's a Wonderful Life?"</s>Or the Bijou.  Either one.</s>I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.</s>
Why did you say those things?</s>I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.</s>
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.</s>Huh?</s>
You live in such a fantasy world...</s>What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...</s>...It was six months, and she didn't dump...</s>...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...</s>
I'll be okay. Holy shit...</s>Don't get up. Take a second...</s>
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.</s>Best damn plan I heard all war.</s>
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?</s>Do you mind?</s>No, I guess not. I'm an actor.</s>
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?</s>I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.</s>What do you imagine you are Louis?</s>I don't pretend to know.</s>Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.</s>
I guess it's not that obvious, then.</s>No.</s>
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.</s>Is that right?</s>I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.</s>You will? For sure?</s>Yeah.</s>We'll be on teams, me and you?</s>Yessir.</s>
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....</s>Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....</s>
Nuts. He made it.</s>Tough guy, huh?</s>
In case you want to have us followed.</s>I don't.</s>Well--good night.</s>
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.</s>They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.</s>The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.</s>
Yes.</s>Good.</s>
Listen, I gotta have money.</s>Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...</s>
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.</s>What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?</s>No, of course not.</s>You mean, I have your permission?</s>Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.</s>I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.</s>Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.</s>Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.</s>
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--</s>Glenn?</s>

Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."</s>Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....</s>Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.</s>

Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.</s>Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.</s>He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.</s>That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.</s>How do I get the horn back?</s>You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.</s>Where do I find the Baron's castle?</s>Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...</s>Not very precise directions.</s>Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.</s>Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.</s>Ask away, sweet man.</s>What became of the princess?</s>Princess?  I know of no princess.</s>Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter.

Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.</s>If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.</s>What?!</s>I said, I'm sorry!</s>If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.</s>
You were burned by some organic acid.</s>I'm lucky that way.</s>

After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.</s>I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.</s>
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.</s>I pray you: be succinct.</s>You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.</s>With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?</s>
Come on, John. What happened?</s>The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.</s>
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.</s>Shit.  Hi, honey.</s>
What does this mean?</s>That you killed Hollis Mulwray.</s>
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.</s>I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...</s>Well I ain't a cop.</s>
Would you like to do me?</s>I just might.</s>I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.</s>
You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.</s>Maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...</s>

Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.</s>Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?</s>Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."</s>The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.</s>Right.</s>
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.</s>How is it this hag knows the truth?</s>Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.</s>Will you lead me to her?</s>Aye.

Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.</s>That hurt my feelings.</s>
Naomi.</s>On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.</s>
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.</s>I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.</s>
How's that working out, by the way?</s>Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.</s>No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.</s>
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.</s>Thanks...  we're taking your cab.</s>

And -- what path is that?</s>We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.</s>Why did you write remember on the wall?</s>That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.</s>Why not?</s>You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.</s>What?</s>

When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.</s>Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.</s>
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.</s>Next time I'll use valet parking.</s>
I borrowed that, too...</s>Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.</s>I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.</s>
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?</s>Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?</s>
You're lying!</s>Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.</s>You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.</s>
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?</s>Ain't it there?</s>
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.</s>First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.</s>I bought him a watch too.</s>Yeah.</s>Yeah.</s>But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?</s>Yeah.</s>At the most, which is impossible for him.</s>
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -</s>I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.</s>And what if he really is a spy?</s>He can't even move.</s>If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.</s>
May I have this dance, Miss?</s>Why, sure!</s>
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.</s>And what would that be, sir?</s>Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?</s>It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.</s>
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.</s>You don't secretly want the attention?</s>I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?</s>
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...</s>Men, huh?</s>
Is this upsetting you?</s>I've seen worse.</s>
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --</s>You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.</s>
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?</s>Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.</s>
Staedert, do you read me?</s>I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .</s>
One, two, three...</s>He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.</s>
Is that what I think it is?</s>Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.</s>
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --</s>This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?</s>Of course.</s>It's a formality; truly.</s>You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.</s>I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.</s>If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?</s>It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.</s>
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.</s>I tried to grab you -- save you --</s>Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.</s>
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.</s>W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?</s>So long, kid.</s>Wh-wh-wh-wh...</s>Shhh...</s>
Are you married?</s>No, I'm divorced.</s>Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.</s>Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.</s>
Where are your parents?  You have to try...</s>Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.</s>
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--</s>What?</s>Your mother will be down in a few minutes.</s>My mother?</s>
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.</s>Ten A.M.</s>Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.</s>
Cat got his tongue?</s>Actually he never told us what it was.</s>
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...</s>Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?</s>
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -</s>I know.  Every time!</s>Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -</s>That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.</s>
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!</s>It might give us something.</s>
You don't recognize me.</s>No. Am I supposed to?</s>
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?</s>The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.</s>
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.</s>No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.</s>I have a tent to myself.</s>People will talk.</s>I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.</s>
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.</s>Who's Guilder?</s>The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!</s>
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.</s>I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.</s>You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...</s>
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.</s>Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.</s>I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.</s>But...</s>Good day.</s>
Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-</s>It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?</s>No, but the whole goddamn – Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?</s>
Yes, Ma'am.</s>Doll, you and Waski run on, too.</s>
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.</s>Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.</s>I'm glad Bill's back.</s>They'd die without each other.</s>
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?</s>He's right.  Follow me.</s>
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.</s>What's this about?</s>Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?</s>Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?</s>Always.</s>
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.</s>Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.</s>
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...</s>They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?</s>See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!</s>
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.</s>How the hell did you do that?</s>Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?</s>I'm supposed to understand this.</s>You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?</s>No.</s>Then let's go have some fun.</s>
Recognize this?</s>It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.</s>Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.</s>They must have picked it up in space.</s>
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.</s>Yeah? Airtight?</s>
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.</s>The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.</s>
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --</s>Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?</s>A higher calling like getting girls and making money?</s>
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.</s>I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.</s>
This is no time to celebrate!</s>Just keep your eyes on the road.</s>
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.</s>I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.</s>That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.</s>
What day is this?</s>Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.</s>Think the tide's with us?</s>Just keep kicking.</s>Y'know, I used to hate the water...</s>I can't imagine why.</s>
My dad was a Navy doctor.</s>Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.</s>Had?</s>She's dead.</s>Oh.</s>Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.</s>How did she..?</s>I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-</s>
Don't you ever have any problems?</s>I have one now.</s>So do I.</s>Tell me about it.</s>Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?</s>He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.</s>Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?</s>Homework. It's more interesting.</s>What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?</s>Nothing, thank heaven.</s>Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?</s>I wouldn't dare answer that.</s>Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.</s>
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."</s>Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.</s>
That's because you had a proper upbringing.</s>That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!</s>Oh! And don't wave your hands about!</s>Respect your elders and your betters!</s>And no elbows on the table!</s>Eating is eating... and...</s>And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.</s>Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.</s>
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.</s>That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.</s>She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.</s>
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.</s>Eileen, Chinese food again?</s>George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.</s>
She makes ten.</s>Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.</s>What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.</s>
Blade.</s>Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!</s>
They were early.</s>What are you talking about?</s>They just left, didn't they?</s>What are you, drunk?</s>
I'm sorry Mom canned you.</s>It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --</s>Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.</s>You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?</s>
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.</s>To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.</s>This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.</s>Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.</s>
What do you mean?</s>You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.</s>
Go where?</s>On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.</s>Nobody told me.</s>I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?</s>They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.</s>Fine.  Have them do some.</s>I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.</s>Yes, aren't we all.</s>
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.</s>You're out of your mind.</s>I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?</s>
Hi, Jack.</s>Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.</s>
I think I've got something to say.</s>Very well ...</s>
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.</s>And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?</s>Yes, it is.</s>I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.</s>Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.</s>You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!</s>
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.</s>But you're the Gods!</s>Look... Erik...</s>
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!</s>He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?</s>
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.</s>The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?</s>
Victor, I'm sorry I --</s>Just <u>find</u> him.</s>
What?</s>I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.</s>I had to tell 'em something.</s>Never say anything unless you have to.</s>
I'm glad you decided to come after all.</s>Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.</s>You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.</s>What about not-so-great writers?</s>
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.</s>Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?</s>
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.</s>Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.</s>
Dr. Thompson...?</s>It was good of you to meet...</s>
What happened? Is it over?</s>I'm taking you home. You're not well.</s>No, no. I have to get back. I have -</s>
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.</s>Sir.</s>
I'm sorry.</s>There's a goddamn sign on the gate.</s>I'm so sorry.</s>You fucking cow, can't you read?!</s>I...</s>How long ago was it?</s>
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...</s>Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!</s>Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?</s>
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.</s>Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.</s>
Hello?</s>It's me again.</s>
Right.</s>I just hope this is still good up there.</s>Mom?</s>
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?</s>You know, Jessica.</s>...But I still have the choice...?</s>Of course.</s>Then the answer's yes...</s>
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.</s>What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?</s>
Inspector.</s>Alderman.</s>
What kind of time frame are we talking about?</s>Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.</s>
You looking for somebody?</s>Wha'?</s>You here to see somebody?</s>Yeah.</s>Who?</s>A girl named Amanda.</s>What she look like?</s>She's like this high, dark hair, skinny</s>Yo, that's my girl.</s>She didn't say she had no man.</s>I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.</s>
What's your name, man?</s>They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.</s>Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?</s>
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?</s>No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.</s>
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!</s>Now, now, don't fret.</s>Oh, dear, dear.</s>We'll get you together!</s>
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...</s>I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.</s>Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.</s>Huh? That's smart!</s>I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.</s>Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?</s>...Composer.</s>Huh, that's good!</s>Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...</s>Huh?</s>...No... he's my lover...</s>

Do you love me?</s>Do you love me?</s>I asked first.</s>Sometimes I think I do.</s>And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!</s>
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.</s>Just one for a start.</s>
-- Anyway.</s>I hope she's all right.</s>She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?</s>I wouldn't say so if I didn't.</s>No, I know.</s>And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.</s>I know.</s>I mean it or I wouldn't say it.</s>That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.</s>
You look good in a dress.</s>You would have looked better.</s>Wanna go for a swim?</s>
Yeah?</s>Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.</s>This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.</s>I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.</s>Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.</s>I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.</s>You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.</s>

Thanks for coming down to see us.</s>Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?</s>
He won't come.</s>He will. I know he will.</s>
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?</s>Tell me the whole story, Walt.</s>There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.</s>There's only one worth noticing.</s>You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...</s>
Now this is just a signature card.</s>So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?</s>That's right.</s>
Lili!  No!</s>Jack... Forgive me...</s>
You all right?</s>No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?</s>
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.</s>Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.</s>
Jesus Christ.</s>You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.</s>Why not?</s>Tradition.</s>What the hell is going on?</s>
Oh, that's nice.</s>Want another cigarette?</s>Sure.</s>
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.</s>Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?</s>How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.</s>
But?</s>I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.</s>
Suppose you listen just for a minute -</s>Madame is waiting.</s>For me?  Okay.</s>
Excuse me?</s>I can be quick.  I can even be funny.</s>
Don't tell me you really are in love?</s>Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?</s>Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.</s>
Maybe we can get in by the top.</s>You want to try?</s>Sure.</s>
Where would we find it?</s>I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.</s>All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.</s>
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.</s>No.</s>
No, you didn't, Bob.</s>Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...</s>
This is bad, Nicky.</s>How bad?</s>I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.</s>
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...</s>Tell me.</s>Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.</s>So?</s>So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.

Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?</s>Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.</s>Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.</s>Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.</s>You've done five of my ideas.</s>You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?</s>They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?</s>A flack jacket.</s>A--flack jacket.</s>Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.</s>You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?</s>Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.</s>Hey--I can be out of control.</s>
What're we going to do?!</s>There's got to be another way out.</s>
I know Manny Davis.</s>Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.</s>

Do Grable.</s>Hey, here's Esther Williams.</s>
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.</s>I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.</s>Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.</s>I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.</s>Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.</s>Like what?</s>I got you out of those bad tax shelters.</s>You were the one who got me in.</s>I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?</s>Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.</s>I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.</s>Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.</s>
Primary circuit is live.</s>Primary trigger switch.</s>

Ten o'clock.</s>
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?</s>Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.</s>
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?</s>Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.</s>
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?</s>What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.

Was it so bad that it turned you off?</s>No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.</s>What was the problem?</s>The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".</s>So you lied to her?</s>Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.</s>How come?</s>I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.</s>And now you can?</s>Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.</s>Don't you get lonely?</s>How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?</s>I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.</s>Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?</s>Not yet. I'm not sure I will.

There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...</s>Subtlety?</s>Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.</s>And you feel the same way with John?</s>Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.</s>Interesting analogy.</s>I'm babbling.</s>No, you're not.</s>God, I m so mad at him!!</s>You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.</s>Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!</s>

IF he was a traitor.</s>You would have killed his brother?</s>Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.</s>

Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?</s>Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.</s>You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...</s>
I don't know what you're talking about.</s>So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.</s>Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.</s>
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?</s>The cameras have arrived, Madame.</s>They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.</s>
...we had to lick his boots clean.</s>He was your snitch.</s>Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.</s>And one good guy.</s>
Mom?</s>I've been so worried, dear. where are you?</s>Nashville.</s>Oh... Well.</s>The car broke down.</s>Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.</s>Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.</s>Next you'll be sick.</s>I feel really good.</s>How are you going to pay when you get sick?</s>I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.</s>Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather</s>I don't know his first name.</s>Bet the sheets are grey.</s>No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.</s>Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.</s>Fungus?</s>He doesn1t have fungus, does he?</s>I don't think so.</s>Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.</s>How do you know if they do?</s>
I beg your pardon.</s>No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.</s>Why not?</s>I saw one.</s>You saw a MiG 21?</s>I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.</s>Where did you see that?</s>It's classified.</s>
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?</s>Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.</s>
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.</s>We work down in the ditch?</s>
How much farther?</s>Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.</s>
So what?</s>So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'</s>They still have to take it to a jury.</s>
Oh, my God.</s>You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?</s>Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!</s>
Really?</s>It is an emergency, isn't it?</s>Yeah.</s>Then get him.</s>Okay.</s>
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.</s>You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...</s>
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.</s>I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.</s>
I...I can't...</s>You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!</s>
Have a great time, honey!</s>But -- who -- what --?</s>
...Nothing.</s>What do we do?</s>If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.</s>Chum?</s>Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...</s>
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?</s>I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.</s>Ah -- that's where reason took hold.</s>Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.</s>Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.</s>But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...</s>You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.</s>
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.</s>We have to talk.</s>Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...</s>I didn't want to spoil our supper...</s>You'd rather spoil our walk home.</s>Yeh, it's cheaper.</s>
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.</s>Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?</s>I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.</s>Sure.</s>
Well, what do you know –– wife.</s>Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?</s>
Just passing through Santa Carla?</s>No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?</s>
You're kidding.</s>Applejack's stuck in the elevator?</s>
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.</s>Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.</s>
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!</s>THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!</s>FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -</s>
Partners?</s>Partners.</s>
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :</s>I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.</s>
Look over there. It's Cameron.</s>Who?</s>Cameron. You remember Cameron.</s>No, I don't.</s>What's he doing here?</s>That's not him.</s>Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!</s>
She's right. They'll string her up.</s>Do you want to come to Argo City?</s>
No. I don't think so. Not right now.</s>Chicken!</s>
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.</s>Okay, okay.</s>
No fair, I'm not armed.</s>Then don't come any closer.</s>Turn it off....</s>No....</s>Off....</s>I have work....</s>I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.</s>
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"</s>Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.</s>Come again?</s>They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.</s>Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?</s>
Look at him take it!</s>Do I set the goddam hook?</s>Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!</s>
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.</s>Yes, I get the point.</s>
Where's he living these days?</s>He's got a new place at Burnham.</s>Address?</s>On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.</s>
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.</s>Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.</s>
I can't fucking believe you!!</s>I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!</s>You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!</s>I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!</s>Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?</s>So the casket fell over! Big deal!</s>Her fucking body fell out!</s>So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!</s>Just... go! Go open the video store.</s>
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.</s>You've got a lot of nerve.</s>No.  What I have is a lot of money.</s>I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.</s>What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.</s>I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.</s>It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.</s>
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...</s>ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!</s>I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -</s>'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?</s>
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—</s>—and that—</s>—and those and them.</s>
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?</s>It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.</s>Really? Why?</s>I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?</s>Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.</s>Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!</s>You burned the score?</s>Oh no! My wife took it out in time.</s>How fortunate.</s>It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.</s>But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.</s>Oh, Excellency, would you?</s>With all my heart, Mozart.</s>Thank you! Oh, thank you.</s>
Deranged.</s>Demented.</s>
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.</s>I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.</s>
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?</s>You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?</s>
Let's go while there is still time.</s>Where?</s>Anywhere.</s>
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.</s>All right. Stand by.</s>
Yeah.</s>He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...</s>
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.</s>You're kidding me.</s>Right through those doors.  The man himself.</s>Jesus...</s>He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.</s>Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...</s>Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.</s>You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?</s>Did better'n that.</s>
Do you want to try your father again?</s>I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.</s>Have we still got power?</s>Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.</s>
Is it my turn again?</s>Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...</s>
I guessed you were straight black.</s>Good guess.</s>
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.</s>Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.</s>
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?</s>Otherwise, you're not ugly.</s>Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.</s>What's with the dark?</s>
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?</s>Old tricks are the best tricks eh?</s>I'm not going.</s>Why not?</s>One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.</s>
You workin' on another book?</s>Yes I am.</s>It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.</s>
...you know and all that.</s>But he said he died instantaneously.</s>
Of course I am.</s>Of course you are.</s>
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...</s>Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.</s>
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?</s>He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?</s>Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --</s>If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.</s>It isn't that --</s>Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.</s>But I want to stay.</s>Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.</s>
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.</s>How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.</s>
The Dolphin was a symptom.</s>Of what?</s>Of a fight he can't win out here.</s>It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...</s>

Monsters in the gelatin...</s>It's a roach, guy --</s>There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...</s>Oh, man --</s>
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?</s>I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?</s>
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?</s>Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.</s>No way!</s>
How many did you put on that time?</s>All of it.</s>There's no more left?</s>
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.</s>When was that?</s>
Come again?</s>It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?</s>

Margo, really...</s>Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?</s>
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?</s>He was a nice horse.</s>Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?</s>

Nice shot.</s>You're an asshole.</s>
Almost two to one -</s>I'm surprised he got the votes he did.</s>Emily!</s>Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.</s>Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -</s>There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -</s>I know that, Emily -</s>Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.</s>Emily, you -</s>Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -</s>It's - all over -</s>

It's time you got some ambition.</s>I always figured I'd live longer without it.</s>Maybe.</s>

It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.</s>

If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.</s>I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...</s>Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.</s>Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.</s>
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.</s>We have no use for your kind.</s>This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.</s>
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?</s>He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.</s>Got it.</s>
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.</s>You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.</s>
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.</s>What do you mean?</s>I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.</s>
Bobby!</s>Not a very good one, but--</s>So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records?

Could we sit down someplace?</s>I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.</s>You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.</s>
Mozart -</s>Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?</s>Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?</s>Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?</s>Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.</s>
Help yourself.</s>While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?</s>
Yes.</s>It's natural.</s>Your kids never cry.</s>Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.</s>They can look forward to that.</s>Sure.</s>Just like we look forward to this.</s>
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.</s>We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!</s>

I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.</s>
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --</s>Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --</s>

Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!</s>You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!</s>Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.</s>Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.</s>

You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.</s>You didn't show it to anybody?</s>Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos.

...But I turned in my knee pads.</s>Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.</s>
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--</s>Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.</s>

I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?</s>Oh, shit, that's not right.</s>
Real effective security...</s>You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?</s>Authority still makes me nervous.</s>
Is Jenny gonna be okay?</s>She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.</s>But is she gonna be okay?</s>How the hell should I know?</s>
You a woodcutter?</s>Farmer.</s>Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.</s>
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.</s>Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...</s>
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.</s>I don't understand.</s>I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.</s>But Elaine --</s>Goodbye.</s>

You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?</s>And you don't?</s>I wish I still thought like you.</s>Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.</s>All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...</s>Oh, that's all.</s>We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.</s>Bullshit.</s>I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.</s>I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.</s>In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.</s>
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.</s>I can't find you.</s>Here!</s>
He's a little farther gone every time.</s>Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.

He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --</s>What about you?</s>I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.</s>
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.</s>Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?</s>

What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.</s>You just go when I say go.</s>Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.</s>
I know that you're evil.</s>I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...</s>And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!</s>No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.</s>
What's up?</s>Where were you?</s>I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.</s>

I think I'm falling in love with you.</s>You don't even know me.</s>Don't you believe in love at first sight?</s>Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.</s>Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?</s>I can't. I'm seeing a friend.</s>Who?</s>That's none of your business.</s>How about tonight?</s>I'm busy.</s>Doing what?</s>That's also none of your business.</s>Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.</s>You truly want to do something to make me happy?</s>Yes.</s>And you promise to abide by it?</s>Without question.</s>Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.</s>What?</s>If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.</s>
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?</s>Yes... a half-steed... white.</s>Who gave you that horse?</s>My king.</s>How many did he give you?</s>Five steeds and a few hackneys...</s>As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?</s>No.</s>What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?</s>Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...</s>Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?</s>And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?</s>

Wasn't that close?</s>Too close.</s>
I was sorry to hear about your wife.</s>Yes ... I got the money.</s>The President would like to know if that was the last payment.</s>I'll bet he would.</s>Is it?</s>In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.</s>
... too young for whisky...</s>This time we'll make an exception.</s>Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...</s>You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.</s>

Where you been?</s>Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.</s>
Nellie Gail Ranch...</s>Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.</s>There's nothing for them to get.</s>Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...</s>I just want my life back...</s>Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.</s>
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.</s>What for?</s>I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.</s>Gas?</s>
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."</s>Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.</s>I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.</s>"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."</s>
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --</s>Adenoids?</s>Lumbago.</s>
Germs?!</s>In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!</s>

And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.</s>Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?</s>
Dolores?</s>It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.</s>You think someone else caused the accident?</s>Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.</s>

Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.</s>And now he will?</s>Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!</s>
How did you get the fucking number?</s>I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....</s>I don't do that.</s>You do it on the inside....</s>Don't tell me what I --</s>...I want you to do it on the outside, too.</s>No!</s>Yes!</s>

So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...</s>Before you go...</s>

Well... yeah.  Sure.</s>Okay.  Talk.</s>I just wanted to... I, uh...</s>
You're hitting on me?</s>You're a beautiful girl, Elle.</s>So everything you just said --</s>I'm a man who knows what I want.</s>
My angel!</s>I'm scared!</s>

Take the whole lot. I won't need it.</s>I told you not to talk that way --</s>Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --</s>Stop it --</s>
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent.

One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.</s>
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.</s>Two more charges to go.</s>
That vase.</s>Shit, I'm sorry.</s>
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.</s>What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.</s>
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.</s>I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.</s>
Who says I don't like you?</s>My friend, with the funny hand.</s>
How is he doing?</s>As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.</s>I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.</s>
I got delayed. I --</s>Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...</s>
Did you get us a room?</s>What?</s>Have you gotten us a room yet?</s>I haven't. No.</s>Do you want to?</s>Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.</s>Do you want me to get it?</s>You?

You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?</s>Depends.  You got a memo?</s>
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.</s>My God.</s>
You know where they are?</s>Sure.</s>How far?</s>About ten kilometers.</s>Sixty Lira?</s>Sixty?</s>
Why did he bring you?</s>A surprise, he said.</s>
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.</s>I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.</s>

Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...</s>...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --</s>-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.</s>
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.</s>Wacko? That a technical term?</s>Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?</s>So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?</s>Exactly.</s>

You know what else I noticed in Jedi?</s>There's more?</s>So they build another Death Star, right?</s>Yeah.</s>Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.</s>Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.</s>And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.</s>Compliments of Lando Calrissian.</s>Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.</s>And you figured it out?</s>Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.</s>Basically.</s>So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.</s>And the second time around...?</s>The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.</s>So?</s>A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.</s>Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.</s>Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.</s>All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?</s>All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.</s>
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?</s>A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.</s>It'll never work.</s>I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.</s>
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?</s>It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.</s>Oh, really.</s>It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.</s>Because I was civil, now you're complaining.</s>I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?</s>Did you just have a brain-fart?</s>Pardon?</s>Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.</s>I think you've resented me from the start, sir.</s>
Get away from there, convict!</s>Just browsing.  Don't touch me....</s>
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.</s>It's that serious, huh?</s>I'm afraid so.</s>
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?</s>Right.</s>It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?</s>Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet...

Really.</s>
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,</s>Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.</s>

Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.</s>We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?</s>Well, preferably in tens and twenties...</s>
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!</s>Go to hell.</s>Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.</s>
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.</s>I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!</s>

Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.</s>When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?</s>So don't show a picture.</s>You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.</s>
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.</s>He will come back.</s>Excuse me?</s>He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.</s>Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.</s>No. But you tend to tie them up.</s>
I got your message and came as quick as I could.</s>I hope I didn't keep you from something.</s>Not at all. What's wrong?</s>It's Cecile.</s>What about her?</s>Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...</s>Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?</s>It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.</s>Ronald? That's crazy.</s>I know. She's so young and he's so -</s>Black.</s>
What do you want?</s>I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.</s>Do you work for her now?</s>Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.</s>Me, too. Randy. Me too.</s>
Dr. Green...</s>I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?</s>They're all heavily armed.</s>All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.</s>What was it?</s>I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.</s>
No way, no day!</s>Give it up girl!</s>
Lazarus?</s>Oh! Gave me a start.</s>I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.</s>You hurt it?</s>I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.</s>Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.</s>Well. It's good to see you.</s>
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...</s>The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.</s>
Thanks for a swell time.</s>Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.</s>I was so bored!</s>Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!</s>At least I'm open to new concepts!</s>And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?</s>This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!</s>Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together.

Why give yourself up?</s>I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.</s>That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?</s>I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.</s>

You don't know anybody?</s>Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.</s>Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg.

When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was.

Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.</s>I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.</s>I doubt that.</s>Why?</s>Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.</s>Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.</s>What's he like?</s>

And they say smokin' is bad for your health.</s>Yeah.</s>
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers.

The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.</s>

Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?</s>Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.</s>No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?</s>Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?

Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.</s>Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.</s>
Primary bomb is live.</s>All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.</s>Master safety on.</s>
What you saw wasn't Lucy.</s>It was, I tell you!</s>What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.</s>

I don't think you understand.</s>What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?</s>Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.</s>Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.</s>
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.</s>Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.</s>

Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.</s>I might have, Walter, but you were never there.</s>Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.</s>
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--</s>I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.</s>Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.</s>Then why did you run away?</s>Because you ran after me.</s>
You lost me.</s>Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.</s>What point is that?</s>The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.</s>Sounds risky to me.</s>You getting cold feet?</s>I'm in till the end.</s>Good.  I'm going to need your support.</s>Can't you just quit?  Walk away?</s>And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.</s>
You're twisted.</s>I know.</s>
Not that way! Through the door!</s>But, sir!</s>
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.</s>We won't let them.</s>No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?</s>
Come on. I'm sorry.</s>Okay.</s>
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.</s>The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.</s>Can you configure it?</s>I believe so.</s>Do it.</s>

You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.</s>And I'm talking about enjoying myself.</s>You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--</s>

White gangs...?  It doesn't track.</s>White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...</s>

So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.</s>Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.</s>
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.</s>What about Eric and Dr. Grant?</s>Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.</s>What about Eric?</s>

What is it?</s>It's a thought I had.</s>Should I open it now?</s>
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?</s>No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...</s>
How did you see me?</s>We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.</s>
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?</s>* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *</s>
Ex-girlfriend?</s>Be right back.</s>

What is that...?</s>...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...</s>It's lovely.</s>A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...</s>My oh my.</s>I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...</s>
What is this, Rogoff?</s>I don't know yet.</s>
Are you okay?</s>Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?</s>Sure.</s>
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...</s>Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.</s>Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...</s>
I'm good, thanks.</s>What are you on?</s>Pardon me?</s>how much weight have you lost?</s>Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.</s>How's your wife?</s>When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.</s>
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.</s>It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.</s>NO! Stop talking like that.</s>I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.</s>You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.</s>In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.</s>
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?</s>Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?</s>
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?</s>I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.</s>
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.</s>Hershe, you were in Cleveland?</s>Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.</s>
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?</s>I ain't interested in your life story.</s>Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.</s>She's the one to blame. Not me.</s>
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?</s>I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.</s>A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?</s>I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.</s>The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.</s>Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?</s>If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.</s>
You think he's drunk somewhere?</s>Wouldn't blame him if he was.</s>Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?</s>What's his rent?</s>Thirty a month.</s>
What's so important in Los Angeles?</s>Your father has business.</s>Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?</s>
Thanks for coming in.</s>Of course.</s>
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.</s>But the Romulans abandoned the plan.</s>As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.</s>Dying?</s>
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.</s>I'm... really sorry.</s>Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.</s>

So tell me ... am I still an angel?</s>With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.</s>

And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes.

I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.</s>

I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.</s>So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.</s>

Is it a planet?</s>Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe.

We had to unlearn everything.</s>Is it intelligent?</s>Intelligent beyond our comprehension.</s>Then it's God, right?</s>It's something.</s>You still don't believe in God?</s>The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!</s>Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?</s>You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?</s>

The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man.

I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'</s>I would. Yeah.</s>Really?</s>I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.</s>You tell me, Mike. What do I do?</s>Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.</s>
What's your point?</s>You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.</s>
All right.</s>So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?</s>I don't know, it was okay, I guess.</s>
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.</s>It was fun, wasn't it?</s>It was the best, kid</s>So, on to the Life Of Christ!</s>Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.</s>

Permission to come aboard, sir.</s>Permission granted.</s>May I ask, where are you bound?</s>San Francisco.  And you?</s>As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.</s>Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...</s>No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.</s>
Sorry.  You asked.</s>No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,</s>Where do I sign?</s>
Yes.</s>And how would you describe him?</s>Quiet.  Real quiet...</s>And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?</s>Seemed...on edge.</s>On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?</s>He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.</s>Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.</s>Just me.</s>
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.</s>I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.</s>

Sorry.</s>Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.</s>
Okay, Mr. Expert.

All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.</s>Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.</s>When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward.

Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.</s>We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.</s>Where are you taking us now anyway?</s>The fourth moon of Yavin.

Do you really understand what they're going to do?</s>I don't have to.</s>Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.

Hello, McCoy.</s>Beynon.</s>News said two persons killed.</s>
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...</s>It's dark!  I can't breathe!</s>
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.</s>What glasses.</s>The drinks...Stay on them.</s>
What're you doing here?!</s>We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.</s>
In the future, we'll be better.</s>What?</s>Nothing.</s>

Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.</s>Oh come on! Why the hostility?</s>Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls.

He's making a fine recovery.</s>He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.</s>
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?</s>Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.</s>Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.</s>

Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.</s>You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.</s>Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...</s>I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.</s>
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--</s>--Nick!!</s>
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.</s>Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.</s>
There is nothing.</s>Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.</s>Very sorry, but you see, no rats!</s>No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.</s>
Jake...</s>It's OK.</s>
Where is it?</s>Right over there.</s>
Can't you--</s>I don't have a weapon.</s>
What?</s>I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...</s>Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons</s>Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...</s>

You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.</s>I'm more comfortable around my people.</s>Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?</s>Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."</s>

I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?</s>Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.</s>-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.</s>

Heather Chandler was that leader but...</s>But she couldn't handle it.</s>

How can I know such a thing?</s>I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.</s>
Something happened to you.</s>Yeah?</s>
T-T-Thanks Alice...</s>Earth to Alice...</s>
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.</s>Do ya?</s>

You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?</s>That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."</s>But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.</s>That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...</s>
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.</s>I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.</s>A means to an end, is that it?</s>That's it.</s>Then I guess we're set.</s>There is one other thing...</s>What's that?</s>
Bundt cake?</s>Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.</s>

It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?</s>So it was recently that you tried this.</s>Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.</s>
She's really kind of hot.</s>She's an attractive older woman.</s>
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...</s>What about Thursdays and Fridays?</s>On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.</s>And Fridays? What do you do then?</s>Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.</s>I'm glad you do.</s>Do you know what I was doing in that shop?</s>What?</s>I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa.

As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.</s>Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.</s>

Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.</s>How are they with kids?</s>They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.</s>So this really does the trick, eh?</s>Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.</s>
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?</s>Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.</s>How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school.

Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?</s>

The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?</s>Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor.

What the hell's that got to do with my father?</s>Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?</s>You charge by the hour?</s>My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.</s>Well, my father left us when I was five-years old.

We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!</s>I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.</s>I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right?

That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!</s>Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.</s>And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.</s>Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.</s>
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?</s>Have you seen Day-Day?</s>

The truth?</s>I'm all ears.</s>That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century.

Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...</s>
So, uh... how's college goin'?</s>Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?</s>Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.</s>You stop him?</s>Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.</s>I know.  Still thinking about retiring?</s>Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.</s>
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?</s>Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.</s>
That could have been worse.</s>Yeah.</s>
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.</s>Me?</s>I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.</s>I see.</s>Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.</s>And you thought you'd come and settle the score?</s>You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.</s>I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.</s>What did you say?</s>The rest meant nothing to me.</s>There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.</s>Thousands of people did die, just different people.</s>But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?</s>Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.</s>
I thought we'd be happy here.</s>Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.</s>

Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life.

I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.</s>Get a ride with somebody.</s>Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.</s>What a guy.</s>
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.</s>So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?</s>Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.</s>

Don't!</s>Stop paddling!</s>
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.</s>Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?</s>Yeah. Why are you asking?</s>I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.</s>

Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?</s>I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?</s>No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.</s>
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.

They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...</s>Splendid, love to see them.</s>
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.</s>You quit trying to stop anybody—</s>Well, at best you might deny it.</s>Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.</s>Traps shut!</s>Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?</s>
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.</s>Newcastle?  Did you start that one?</s>I thought you did.</s>

And that it's not in your nature to let me go.</s>Shut the fuck up, would you?</s>And you know the funny thing?</s>No, what's the funny thing?</s>I didn't even fancy her.</s>
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?</s>Hallelujah, Jaffar.</s>So you're not just talkin' mob guys.

I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.</s>Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this.

At point blank range?</s>In the leg.</s>I gotta go to Little Rock.</s>

Let's get inside.</s>First enormous brick warehouse on your right.</s>
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..</s>Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.</s>I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.</s>He won't even know you're there.

How did we get here?</s>Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.</s>I think think a lie stinks.</s>Oh Captain, that is so true.</s>Stinks.

Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?</s>Permission to speak candidly, sir?</s>Very well.</s>I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.</s>And why not?</s>Because... there was no way to win.</s>A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face.

It has not.</s>How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?</s>As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.</s>Then you have something new to think about.

Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.</s>I like you, Maude.</s>I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.</s>
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?</s>Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.</s>Not if you're with him every step of the way.</s>The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.</s>I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.</s>

I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.</s>If you knew, why didn't you say anything?</s>The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there.

She ate a meal that would choke a pig!</s>That's incredible.</s>Yes.</s>
An odd selection, Mr Case.</s>I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.</s>Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.</s>Can you read my mind?</s>I can access your memories, but I have my limitations.

And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.</s>Miles. Miles. Miles.</s>I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.</s>It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.</s>Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?</s>Have you tried the duck?</s>I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.</s>

You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.</s>Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.</s>

Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?</s>I used the last one to jump off the cliff...</s>Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.</s>I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.</s>We'll get a ride in the morning.</s>
How do you do that?</s>Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.</s>

You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment.

I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.</s>Your wife?</s>She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.</s>

He helped him carry home the clean laundry.</s>He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.</s>He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.</s>What about me?</s>I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.</s>Karl is a guy guy?</s>
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.</s>A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!</s>
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.</s>I don't want to know...</s>
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?</s>Huh...? No...no water.</s>

And roosters.</s>No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --</s>No, sir --</s>Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.</s>Sir --</s>
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.</s>I was just thinking that.</s>
I was driven out.</s>And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.</s>How can you know this?</s>First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.</s>
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.</s>What do you mean?</s>Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.</s>Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.</s>What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?</s>
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...</s>You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.</s>Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...</s>I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.

Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?</s>Come on—get in.</s>Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—</s>Come on! come on!</s>What happened?</s>Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!</s>What'd you give him for the car?</s>A black eye.</s>
Hi, Elena!</s>Hi. Why are you running?</s>No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?</s>Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.</s>Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!</s>

So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.</s>You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.</s>She tells you how I've been--</s>--a philandering pig.</s>But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.</s>Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.</s>I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.</s>How'd you get her out of town?</s>Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.</s>And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?</s>She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.</s>I'll give it my best shot.</s>Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?</s>You don't.</s>
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?</s>I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.</s>
That's not it.  That's not the list.</s>What's the matter, you don't know this trick?</s>
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?</s>Sam Lowry.</s>Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.</s>Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?</s>What?</s>I'll bring it back in ten minutes.</s>You want to take my console into your office?</s>Yes.</s>I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing.</s>
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.</s>You've been cheating on me haven't you?</s>Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.</s>Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.</s>
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?</s>Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.</s>
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?</s>No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.</s>Well, everybody needs a hobby.</s>No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.</s>
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...</s>No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.</s>
Speak English!</s>You said speak Czech!</s>How you erase this?</s>I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!</s>

It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.</s>I do the research.</s>
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?</s>Never.

Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.</s>You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.</s>

Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.</s>Vodka tonic.</s>Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?</s>
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.</s>That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.</s>I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.</s>
Heineken.</s>FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!</s>
But, we have to make a smart plan!</s>Of course - of course!  Hands in...</s>
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.</s>Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.</s>The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.</s>Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.</s>The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.</s>Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].</s>The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Léone.</s>
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...</s>Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --</s>
This is kind of a cool place.</s>I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.</s>Will you give Mom a break?</s>
She looks like she stinks.</s>Cat fight, cat fight.</s>
What are we going to do?</s>Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.</s>
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.</s>Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.</s>Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.</s>
"Eloi"?</s>What are your people called?</s>Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.</s>New Yorkers.</s>
What do I have to do to stop it?</s>I want you here.</s>You're lying.</s>You exist here.  I keep telling you.</s>That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.</s>Who are you, then?</s>I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.</s>Yes, you are --</s>Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?</s>Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.</s>But then I would be dead now.</s>
Oww!</s>Careful.  What's wrong?</s>Nothing.</s>Nothing, huh?</s>That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?</s>Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?</s>Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.</s>Oh.  Want to talk about it?</s>No.</s>Terrific.</s>
Go on.</s>I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?</s>
Now, what's this?</s>Give it to me!</s>Mexico?  You going to Mexico?</s>I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!</s>This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.</s>
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?</s>I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.</s>
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.</s>Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?</s>Well, look who's here.</s>
You okay?!</s>Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?</s>No thank you, you crazy old woman.</s>Old woman?</s>Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...</s>I get it.</s>

Our chaperon.</s>Pity your mother came, too ...</s>
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?</s>Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.</s>But I mean isn't he Faith's new--</s>Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.</s>
Where the hell could they have gone!</s>What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.</s>I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...</s>You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?</s>
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?</s>If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.</s>You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.</s>

Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.</s>Answer the phone.</s>No.  Tell me what you want to say.</s>Answer it.</s>Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?</s>
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.</s>"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."</s>This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.</s>
Did I say jerk?</s>I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?</s>
Naked!?</s>Naked.</s>
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!</s>Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!</s>

Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?</s>Sir, yes, sir!</s>LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find!

Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.</s>For everyone.</s>Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...</s>Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?</s>Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.</s>I can't do that.</s>Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.</s>I hate chickens.</s>
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.</s>Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.</s>We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.</s>

It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!</s>'How I Did It.'  Good title!</s>Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?</s>

All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?</s>Fine. And here's a kiss for you.</s>
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?</s>It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.</s>That is why they call it coach?</s>Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.</s>You have taken business class?</s>Many times.</s>

You're really something Coco...thank you.</s>Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.</s>
So how's your work?</s>It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.</s>Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?</s>I don't know, I don't care.

It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.</s>Good strategy.</s>Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...

Up a little there... What would you say?</s>Up.</s>
Probably on his way back right now.</s>Sam, I'm going.</s>You'll never find it.</s>
Ford, you were right!</s>Ye-ah.</s>
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?</s>Excuse me?</s>I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?</s>I was afraid of this.</s>
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?</s>Hey, little Dale Evans.</s>
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --</s>-- fuck you.</s>
Well?</s>Home free.</s>
Just give me an example...</s>For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...</s>
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.</s>Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?</s>
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.</s>Yeah, poor bastard.</s>I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.

Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.</s>Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?</s>Reach for the limit I always say.</s>I'll remember that, my Lordship.</s>

Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?</s>How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...

They're all the same.</s>That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning.

And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.</s>Slow down, huh?</s>Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.</s>

Tell me again how it started.</s>Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.

That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.</s>Thanks for the drink.</s>Wait a minute.

For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.</s>You think I can lose?</s>I never saw you do anything else.</s>You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.</s>Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.</s>Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.</s>I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.</s>Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.</s>No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.</s>Kiss off.</s>

Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.</s>You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.</s>
It's not for sale.</s>Who said I wanted to buy it?</s>
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.</s>You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.</s>Well, I am.</s>
It's good to see you.</s>It's good to be back, Lloyd.</s>What'll it be, sir?</s>
Sure!</s>Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?</s>Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.</s>No problem, is it at your place?</s>Yeah.</s>
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...</s>So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...</s>
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.</s>I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.</s>In case of what?</s>In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.</s>Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.</s>We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.</s>
So what do you feel like doing tonight?</s>I don't know. What do you feel like doing?</s>
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?</s>Up to six weeks, I think.</s>How are we going to cope?</s>
What are you doin' --</s>Lookin' around.</s>
Hey, what are you doing?!</s>I know a short-cut.</s>
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...</s>You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...</s>Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...</s>
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?</s>You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.</s>

Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.</s>What was that boyfriend's name?</s>We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.</s>Stens?  Was it Stens?</s>Maybe.  I don't know.</s>Look at a picture for me.</s>
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?</s>A massive cardiac arrest.</s>What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?</s>Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.</s>Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?</s>No.</s>What induced it?</s>We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.</s>So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?</s>I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.</s>Then how did it get into his body?</s>We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.</s>
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.</s>Oh come on --</s>This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.</s>You're imagining it.</s>

I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.</s>It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?</s>I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.</s>How long have you been here?</s>Three nights.</s>And how long did I tell you you could stay?</s>Two or three nights.</s>It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?</s>I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?</s>No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.</s>You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.</s>Are you going to be all right?</s>Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means.</s>Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?</s>Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.</s>Take good care of yourself, okay?</s>You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer.</s>

He's not talking about himself.</s>Then what's he talking about?</s>If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.</s>
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.</s>You really believe that?</s>

How's the case coming?</s>Okay.</s>Anything you can tell me?</s>The criminals are winning.</s>Is that why you say it's horrible?</s>Yes.</s>I guess you've seen some bad things.</s>Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.</s>Why do you do it?</s>I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.</s>Yeah. I get it.</s>
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.</s>A what?</s>It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.</s>But they'd still get the idea, right?</s>You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?</s>It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.</s>Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.</s>Before they kill somebody else, too.</s>Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house.

And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.</s>Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?</s>Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.

After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote.

He's a hairdresser.</s>You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?</s>Yes, but... I thought...</s>What?</s>That you were just indulging me.</s>No, doll, I listen to you.

Thin man extraordinaire!</s>Two hundred dollars, please.</s>Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!</s>

Son.</s>Well, why should I?</s>They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.</s>I guess.</s>They did do one great thing.

Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?</s>Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.</s>Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.</s>
What's so funny?</s>I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated.

You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.

Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.</s>
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...</s>What's wrong?</s>I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty.

Fleet, maybe.</s>Your father will never let you.</s>I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.</s>Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?</s>Eight point... no, uh, seven...</s>If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.</s>All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.</s>Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.</s>
Where are you now?</s>Here with you.</s>Where?</s>The tall trees...</s>Have you been here before?</s>Yes...</s>When?</s>
No. We <u>all</u> go.</s>Anna--</s>--fuck Anna!</s>
Do you know a Marie?</s>No... do you?</s>Why should I?</s>I don't know.</s>
So what's wrong?</s>Nothing, nothing at all.</s>I mean...with your car.</s>Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.</s>Excuse me?</s>I was commenting on your hair.</s>Oh, are you a hairdresser?</s>I'm a pediatric cardiologist.</s>Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?</s>Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.</s>
A full night on the street and this is all?</s>Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.</s>
And what if I say no?</s>You know what. Go.</s>
My grandmother's .</s>What?</s>That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.</s>
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.</s>But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.</s>Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?</s>
I thought you were in a meeting--?</s>I am.  With you.</s>
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.</s>Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.</s>David?</s>
Are you kidding me?</s>Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --</s>
Will you come in, please?</s>What?</s>I want you to come in till I get the lights on.</s>What for?</s>Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.</s>
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?</s>I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.</s>Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.</s>Even if you found us -- what then?</s>I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.</s>Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.</s>Not a chance.</s>Don't say that.</s>Do you know what's in that box?</s>I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.</s>
Where is everybody?</s>Well - it's cold, Margie.</s>
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.</s>Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.</s>
Don't do it, Norman!</s>Do you see it?</s>
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --</s>Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.</s>Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!</s>Yes, darling.</s>
Well, I guess it's about that time.</s>I guess so. Follow me.</s>
My wife? What's she got to do with you?</s>No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.</s>
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...</s>He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.</s>
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.</s>How do you do?</s>
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.</s>I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.</s>
...Who let you in?</s>I --</s>
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.</s>One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.</s>What radio?</s>The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.</s>
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?</s>Is Mr. Deeds in?</s>No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.</s>
Well, yes, actually.</s>He always has two or three going...</s>
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.</s>You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.</s>
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.</s>Man, fuck you!!!</s>No Fuck you!!!</s>
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.</s>Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..</s>
And there's Dmitri...</s>The honey trap.  And there's the honey.</s>Hello, Miss Ukraine...</s>
No Mac, please... I --</s>Don't look.</s>
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.</s>Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.</s>
Excuse me -- what did you say?</s>Monkeys.  Twelve of them.</s>
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.</s>Are you still in touch?</s>Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.</s>Which one?</s>Which one?</s>Which clinic?</s>I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.</s>Sunnyridge.  That was a long time</s>
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.</s>Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...</s>...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.</s>
Was a member of...?  Speak up?</s>I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.</s>Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?</s>You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that -</s>
What the hell do you care?</s>I was just asking, Bill.</s>You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.</s>
There's little chicks!  You want to see?</s>Sure.</s>
Jesus... They can tell that...</s>They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!</s>You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.</s>
Lil was wearing a sour face.</s>What do you mean?</s>Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.</s>
What do you think?</s>Mmm, needs a little something.</s>What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.</s>Yeah that's it.</s>Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.</s>Scottie...</s>
What was his voice like?</s>You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.</s>Did he pay?</s>Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.</s>And Oswald?</s>Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...</s>So you saw Oswald how many times?</s>Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...</s>
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --</s>There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --</s>It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?</s>Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --</s>What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.</s>All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --</s>It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.</s>
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.</s>Oh, yes, that's right.</s>
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.</s>Send it away -- I shan't need it.</s>
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?</s>I want you to leave.  And never come back.</s>
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?</s>Sure.</s>
I gotta go.</s>Will you call me tomorrow?</s>Yeah, sure.</s>Promise?</s>Yeah.</s>
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --</s>Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.</s>
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.</s>All right, hit those lights too.</s>
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?</s>They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.</s>That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.</s>
I don't know you.</s>Ahhh, but I know you.</s>How?</s>We met in court.</s>We never met in court or anyplace else.</s>That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.</s>When?</s>Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?</s>I didn't break that window!</s>No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!</s>What are you? A policeman?</s>I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.</s>What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...</s>Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.</s>You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...</s>Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?</s>I think you're a louse.</s>I am.  Good day.  Madam.</s>And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!</s>I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.</s>
At least he doesn't have a beard....</s>Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?</s>
Who? Rob?</s>Yeah. You met him once.</s>Yeah. He's a "rounder".</s>
Who is the mark?</s>Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.</s>
So what's he doing? You believe him?</s>It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...</s>Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.</s>
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?</s>No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?</s>
Mikey's the big winner.</s>What an asshole.</s>Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.</s>
Why do you keep doing this?</s>I love the outfits.</s>
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?</s>No, wait... what happened next, Betty?</s>Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?</s>
Then what were we talking to you for?</s>I had to lay eyes on you.</s>
It's a ...baby.</s>What's your name, boy?</s>Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?</s>
I said let's go.</s>One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.</s>I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.</s>
There's dust in it.</s>This one?</s>A hair.</s>This one?</s>Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.</s>
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?</s>Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.</s>
Where do we go now?</s>Yeah.</s>
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.</s>Hold it.</s>
What'd you say about me?</s>Shut the fuck up.</s>
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.</s>Your daughter.</s>
Step number two.</s>Okay.</s>
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.</s>Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.</s>
When would Agnes have conceived the child?</s>Oh, some time in January.</s>Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?</s>Earthquakes?</s>Visitors to the convent.</s>Nothing.</s>Do you have a... a diary or a day book?</s>Yes.</s>Take at look at it.</s>
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!</s>THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!</s>
We will see who is the first to die.</s>Very well. I'll wager a dinner.</s>
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?</s>You can?</s>
So, why did you take me up there?</s>I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?</s>
Is he alright?  What happened?</s>The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?</s>
Jackie Shawn.</s>Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.</s>
How've you been?</s>Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.</s>I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.</s>I've been swimming, Merv.</s>
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?</s>What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?</s>Stop it!</s>
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.</s>Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.</s>
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.</s>Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.</s>It should, but I found it and now I claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  Seize the cave.</s>
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.</s>Great.</s>
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.</s>Believe me, that won't be a problem.</s>
Left...The one with the red dot.</s>Well...?</s>It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.</s>
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.</s>They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!</s>
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"</s>Unprofessional.</s>You just can't bear the idea of good news.</s>You're sitting on your ticket.</s>
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --</s>You'll feel better tomorrow.</s>Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...</s>
What?</s>You're kidding.</s>
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?</s>Straylight. Kitchen dock.</s>
Do you know what C.P. Time is?</s>C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.</s>
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?</s>She's the Scream Queen.</s>
Katharine!</s>Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.</s>
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.</s>Thanks.</s>If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.</s>It doesn't hurt.</s>It's why you attract a client like my daughter.</s>Probably.</s>But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.</s>No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.</s>
--yeah, a hand or something--</s>--coming out of the water--</s>
Wow...</s>What'd you find, Kathy?</s>
What is it, Alice?</s>I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.</s>
I'd like it if you could stay the night.</s>Oh, right.  Alright.</s>Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.</s>I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.</s>So you'll stay?</s>Yeah.</s>Good.</s>
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...</s>Crow Horse, listen --</s>Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.</s>Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.</s>You got Jimmy. Let her go.</s>Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.</s>Why? So you can get rid of me, too?</s>No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.</s>
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.</s>STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.</s>
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.</s>A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?</s>
What kind of exercise?</s>Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.</s>
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.</s>I can't breathe.</s>I'm a bit nervous, myself --</s>
Looking for someone?</s>You never know who you'll see.</s>
The door from the patio, in back.</s>You broke in?</s>No, it was open. It wasn't locked.</s>What if it was?</s>
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.</s>First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?</s>It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.</s>Give me the gun.</s>The gun! ... I lost it</s>You're sure?</s>No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!</s>
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.</s>He's got nothing to do with me.</s>I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.</s>He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.</s>
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?</s>We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.</s>Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.</s>
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.</s>We've already met.</s>And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...</s>I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.</s>
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....</s>Never mind that shit.  Just point.</s>
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.</s>Wait a minute.</s>I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.</s>
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!</s>Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.</s>
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.</s>What about?</s>On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.</s>
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.</s>We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?</s>About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.</s>And I was in it?  What did I do?</s>You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.</s>It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.</s>
How are you today?</s>Okay, I guess.</s>Here we are.</s>
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.</s>You bring the cigarettes?</s>Oh, sure.</s>
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.</s>It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.</s>
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.</s>Oh that's nice for you.</s>
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.</s>From over the mountain --</s>
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?</s>Yeah.</s>Hell, good luck!</s>Good luck to you too, Paul.</s>Thanks!</s>
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.</s>Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.</s>
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.</s>It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.</s>
Give me the gun.</s>Her pretty head.</s>
You boys'll have to go to work early.</s>You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.</s>
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.</s>Nothing for Kuzawa?</s>Shapiro. Shapiro.</s>Just what makes you so popular?</s>
It's up to you now, Angel!</s>I'm so tired...</s>You can sleep tomorrow... come on...</s>I want to sleep... forever...</s>Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!</s>
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?</s>Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?</s>
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.</s>Four aces, Doc.</s>
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?</s>I married into it.</s>
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.</s>So you're the new meat?</s>Yes, sir.</s>What did you do to end up here?</s>I believe it's in my file, sir.</s>Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?</s>Thomas Mackelway.</s>Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?</s>Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.</s>Sounds like fun.</s>
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.</s>Could be risky.</s>Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.</s>No, I mean doing it at my house.</s>Afraid of getting caught?</s>Maybe.</s>You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?</s>Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.</s>I'm intrigued.</s>You're intrigued?</s>Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.</s>
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.</s>If we get him, I'll be happy enough.</s>No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.</s>How can you say that?  Especially after today?</s>Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.</s>You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.</s>You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?</s>You do your job...</s>Where's the victory?</s>You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.</s>Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.</s>Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.</s>
Mark, are you okay?</s>Yeah.  I'm just aces.</s>
Sophy?  Are you okay?</s>Mommy, where are you?</s>Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.</s>When?</s>Soon, baby.</s>Mommy, I'm scared.</s>There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.</s>
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?</s>I have told the truth.</s>You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.</s>
It's just a shot to calm you.</s>No more drugs.  Please...</s>I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.</s>
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.</s>What's the matter with you?</s>
Doesn't he live here?</s>No, he doesn't.</s>Are you sure?</s>You saw the ad in the Times?</s>No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?</s>There was no ad in the Times.</s>
When could I look round?</s>Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...</s>
Will you stand still so I can do this!</s>I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?</s>In a bar called Hellfire.</s>Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?</s>No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.</s>What are the other reasons?</s>
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."</s>Hey -</s>
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.</s>I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...</s>You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'</s>That's spectacularly unfair.</s>Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.</s>
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --</s>-- Richard.</s>Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.</s>
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?</s>Anti-Shark cage.</s>Who's inside, you or the shark?</s>
Partially...</s>It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.</s>
Got a cigarette?</s>Sure...</s>
No record of him.</s>You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.</s>
So there is a way to fool the system?</s>Yes.</s>
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.</s>Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!</s>I'm afraid that's not possible.</s>Why not?</s>We haven't implanted it yet.</s>
Do I know you?</s>I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...</s>If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --</s>You don't understand.</s>No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.</s>Will you let me explain!</s>And what're you whispering for?</s>I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.</s>
... Yes?</s>We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.</s>Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.</s>What's  your name, son?</s>Brandon.</s>Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?...

I know you meant it constructively but...</s>It's okay. Listen-</s>... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-</s>It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.</s>I knew it!... I KNEW it!...</s>Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.</s>
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.</s>I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?</s>
...are you with the Consulate?</s>Something like that. Cigarette?</s>
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?</s>I wouldn't know.</s>That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.</s>How'd you get in here?</s>The door was open.</s>No it wasn't.</s>Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.</s>What do you want?</s>You ever do any hunting, Peter?</s>
Go ahead.</s>Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.</s>Why do you want to teach me?</s>I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.</s>And if I use them to kill you?</s>That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.</s>
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..</s>It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?</s>I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.</s>You want me to stop the car?</s>
That's great, now make a left, then straight!</s>Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.</s>
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?</s>My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.</s>
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.</s>Barbara --</s>Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.</s>The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.</s>If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.</s>Look, I'm as worried as you are --</s>No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.</s>Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.</s>
Nick?</s>Right here.</s>
I see you're prospering without me.</s>It's been a while.</s>Where's the dog?</s>
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!</s>You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.</s>
What? What is it?</s>Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.</s>Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.</s>That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.</s>It still doesn't mean...</s>He said he'd prove it.</s>
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.</s>Lucky I was there to save you.</s>You jumped in?</s>Only to help the medics, I assure you.</s>My wallet.</s>
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?</s>This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?</s>The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.</s>What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?</s>Right behind you.</s>
Where we going?</s>Beats me.</s>
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'</s>Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.</s>'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'</s>Not our kind of people, you understand.</s>Spot right here.</s>
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?</s>Around here?  Why would they?</s>Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...</s>Yeah, vibrations in the ground.</s>Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.</s>
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...</s>Uh, is your mother ... still alive?</s>Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...</s>She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?</s>
I cannot stay.</s>Why not?</s>I'm leaving in the morning.</s>
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?</s>It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.</s>It's valuable.  Hang onto it.</s>No.  You take it.</s>
....no....</s>Yeah? So what are you doing, then?</s>...just talking to you....</s>Are your pants off?</s>No.</s>I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.</s>Really?</s>Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?</s>It doesn't matter.</s>What do you mean it doesn't matter?</s>Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.</s>I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....</s>Really?</s>What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?</s>It doesn't matter.</s>Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?</s>No.</s>You have a girlfriend?</s>...yes...</s>Where is she?</s>She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.</s>
And I really don't know your noises yet.</s>Well, when you wonder, ask me.</s>Okay... I will...</s>
You didn't tell David?</s>No.  Just you.</s>Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.</s>
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.</s>Okay, stop.</s>
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.</s>Not at all.  It was fascinating.</s>Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?</s>You and 'Honey'?</s>My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.</s>I'm sorry --</s>Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?</s>What's the way?</s>Nothing lasts.</s>I agree --</s>Why?</s>I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?</s>I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.</s>So you're a one-girl guy?</s>Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.</s>
What do you do, if I may be so bold?</s>I'm just an accountant.</s>Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?</s>
Yes, Caesar?</s>Jerses -- tomorrow...</s>
Yes.</s>Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.</s>Yes.</s>
How'd you know it was me?</s>Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.</s>
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?</s>Whatever.</s>
What's he saying?</s>He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.</s>
And where do you lead, boy?</s>To the place where Death lives.</s>It should be an interesting journey, then.</s>That I promise you.</s>I compel no man to follow me on this journey.</s>
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.</s>This be it?</s>Y'all take American Express?</s>Yessir.</s>Then lemme throw in a couple more things.</s>
Did their son see it happen?</s>I don't know.</s>
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?</s>I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.</s>Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?</s>No, just the paper will be fine.</s>Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.</s>Annie, what's the matter?</s>What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.</s>
But if we take their money and supplies...</s>Exactly.</s>
N-n-no, not that.</s>Hello?</s>Like--</s>
My, that fudge smells yummy!</s>It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!</s>
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?</s>Thank you.</s>Keep the packet.</s>
It feels fine now, Jabez.</s>Will you come into town with me tomorrow?</s>I'd love to.</s>
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?</s>Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.</s>I wish my funbags would get bigger.</s>Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.</s>Hot!</s>
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.</s>Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.</s>That fellow got on at Baskul.</s>What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.</s>
What?</s>In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.</s>Do what?</s>What you said to me in the room.</s>What did I say?</s>You asked me if I would --</s>
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.</s>Why do you think I keep her here?</s>Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.</s>
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!</s>Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--</s>
The law forbids it.</s>Love demands it.</s>
Blue moon...</s>You knew just what I was there for.</s>
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.</s>You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !</s>
That's the door.</s>You rest. I'll get it...</s>
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?</s>My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.</s>
What's wrong with him?</s>What do you think?</s>Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.</s>He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.</s>I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --</s>Don't even say it, man.</s>
Is your dad here?</s>He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?</s>
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.</s>No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.</s>No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--</s>
Yes?</s>Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.</s>
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?</s>Whatta you think?</s>Ain't sure, what's the story?</s>What?</s>The story -- what's happenin'?</s>
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?</s>Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.</s>Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.</s>
And the students?</s>I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.</s>How do I know this isn't a trap?</s>You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?</s>I'll need to make a phone call.</s>You may use my office.</s>
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.</s>Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...</s>

Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --</s>That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.</s>I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?</s>Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?</s>It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?</s>I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.</s>That happens, you'll get it back.</s>Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.</s>What do you think Mom would say?</s>Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.</s>
What'd she sing?</s>People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.</s>Wow. You ever see her again?</s>No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?</s>
You need me, I'll be here all night.</s>Thanks, Max.</s>
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...</s>To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?</s>
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.</s>So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.</s>Aye, but will they?</s>John, it's not your problem what she eats.</s>The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.</s>

Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.</s>Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.</s>
Is there any syrup?</s>Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.</s>
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.</s>I still will, if you don't mind.</s>
What's in your head, boy?</s>She.  Goes.  Free.</s>You've got one shot -- and we can't die.</s>You can't.  I can.</s>
It's a long story, this one.</s>The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.</s>You demand a lot from your readers, you do.</s>
Make a right.  You can't miss it.</s>I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.</s>
You don't know him?</s>No! Should I?</s>

Good evening. How are you feeling?</s>Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?</s>Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.</s>
Of what?</s>A bullet to the right cerebellum.</s>She was murdered?</s>No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.</s>
Say that again, son.</s>I beg your pardon?</s>I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.</s>I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.</s>We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.</s>
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!</s>Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.</s>

She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!</s>She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!</s>
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?</s>They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.</s>What the fuck, man?

--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.</s>If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?</s>That's a very personal question.</s>I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?</s>Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?</s>I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.</s>I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.</s>It is.</s>Do you always open quickly?</s>Are we talking about me, or chess?</s>You.</s>Each circumstance requires a different tactic.</s>Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.</s>
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.</s>It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.</s>And what can he do for you?</s>Can the maker repair what he makes?</s>Would you like to be modified?</s>Had in mind something a little more radical.</s>What's the problem?</s>Death.</s>I'm afraid that's a little out of my...</s>

Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?</s>I'm all right.</s>You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.</s>
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.</s>He's going to kill Fanucci.</s>Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!</s>
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.</s>Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.</s>
...Ed, I...</s>What is it, Dave?</s>
You dropped a glass.</s>I...</s>A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...</s>In the living room...</s>You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.</s>But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--</s>It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.</s>But I don't remember.</s>Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.</s>What's wrong with me?</s>
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...</s>That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...</s>That's right...</s>...take <u>any</u> two people...</s>
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.</s>Bye.</s>
I have to leave. Tonight.</s>Why?</s>This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.</s>No one's ever left.</s>
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?</s>I don't get it.</s>You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?</s>
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.</s>Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.</s>

Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.</s>No.</s>No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?</s>Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!</s>No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --</s>You get the Christ out!

Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus.

She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.</s>
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.</s>There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.</s>
Oh, yeah... the explosion.</s>Know what I love about dynamite?</s>Do tell.</s>When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.</s>I don't think so.</s>Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.</s>
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.</s>Come up here a minute.</s>

How in the fuck do you know that?</s>Do you want Rath or not?</s>
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.

Five minutes to Cloud boundary!</s>I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...</s>
Yes sir.</s>I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?</s>
Please answer the question, Doctor.</s>Is it possible.  Yes.  But --</s>Thank you, Doctor.  Now --</s>-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.</s>
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.</s>... I see.</s>
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.</s>But if she dies...</s>It's only mortal death.</s>
Where'd they go?</s>I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--</s>Weird they didn't chase us.</s>
This is great reefer.</s>Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.</s>The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.</s>What are you shooting for?</s>Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'</s>Don't you get along with your parents?</s>The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.</s>They care about you. They're just a different generation.</s>Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?</s>I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.</s>
So start at the beginning...</s>Give her a chance, will you?</s>I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?</s>
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.</s>Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.</s>
Are you going out somewhere?</s>No.</s>So how come you're putting lipstick on?</s>A girl's always gotta look her best.</s>I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.</s>Have you ever tried any?</s>No.</s>Come here, sit down.</s>

But what reason could he have? What possible reason?</s>Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.</s>I knew Tom never wrote that letter.</s>What else do you know?</s>I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.</s>We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.</s>I don't believe Tom's alive.</s>
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?</s>We definitely had a moment or two.</s>
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.</s>What? Another letter from your friend?</s>This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.</s>You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?</s>I sincerely doubt it.</s>Give me the fucking letter.</s>
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.</s>Hang on, Voltaire.</s>
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.</s>I don't have to.

Frank's the best pilot in the program.</s>I'm so excited, Simon.</s>I guess this is a first for you.</s>No, I've been excited before.</s>
But they're not destroyed, not yet.</s>Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.</s>
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.</s>Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...</s>Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.</s>I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way.

Did you hear the child out?</s>Well, it seemed to me --</s>You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.</s>I'm never unfair.</s>You're shouting at me.</s>I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!</s>
Well...</s>Yes?</s>Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.</s>
Next time, page me first.</s>Okay.</s>
Ten years. What happened!?</s>I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.</s>Thank you.</s>
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.</s>Who is that?</s>
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?</s>I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.</s>
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.</s>I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.</s>
To infinity and beyond!</s>Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?</s>Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!</s>
Now?  Now?</s>Now.  Yes...When?</s>
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.</s>Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?</s>Where did you learn to do this?</s>

Where are you going?</s>She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.</s>
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!</s>Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!</s>

I'll think about it.  I'm okay.</s>Oh, you're more than okay.</s>
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...</s>Like family, huh?</s>
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.</s>Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.</s>
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.</s>Where'd you come from?</s>I don't know.

Thank you, Bobby.</s>You're welcome, Grace.</s>You're not from around here, are you?</s>Why you say that?

You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.</s>My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.</s>There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.</s>

Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.</s>Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.</s>
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.</s>You hold him. I'll slug him.</s>

Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.</s>What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.</s>I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.</s>Keep away!</s>

Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.</s>

Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.</s>What?</s>They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.</s>

Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?</s>Yes.</s>And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.</s>
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.</s>I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.</s>I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.</s>

Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.</s>Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.</s>I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.

Hi.</s>Tough day.</s>My sympathies.</s>Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.</s>We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.</s>I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.</s>I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!</s>I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.</s>That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.</s>It's going to get worse, honey.</s>

He's a little prick!</s>
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.

You're a genius, Babe - a genius!</s>I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.</s>Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here.

He's dead.</s>We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.</s>No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here.

We'll never talk again period. I love you.</s>Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.</s>I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.</s>No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.</s>Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest.

Six thousand, right?</s>On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.</s>How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?</s>Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.</s>That won’t be an issue, believe me.

Somebody called you?</s>Can we come in?</s>What do you want?</s>We'd like to come in.</s>No, you can't come in.</s>
I want to do him!</s>I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.</s>What are you talking about -- who?</s>That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?</s>Fuck you!</s>
We're going to the morgue.</s>That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.</s>On whose orders?</s>General McAddie's.</s>

Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?</s>Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.</s>Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?</s>It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.</s>
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...</s>Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.</s>I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.

Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.</s>Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?</s>
Walter.</s>Do you have many friends?</s>No.</s>How come?</s>A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.</s>It sounds like you were banished.</s>Banished... yeah.</s>Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.</s>Robin?</s>Yes?</s>Would you like to sit on my lap?</s>
Who said this was murder?</s>No one yet.</s>Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.</s>

Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.</s>Yes, she is fairly fabulous.</s>
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?</s>John . . .</s>
That her?</s>Yeah.</s>Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.</s>
Now look, did you buy anything?</s>Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.</s>All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.</s>This way.</s>
Thanks.</s>You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.</s>You ain't seen nothing yet.</s>
Did you tell Sandy?</s>Tell Sandy? What?</s>
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.</s>Hey!  Where are the brakes?</s>Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!</s>
You might not have done it had you known.</s>You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!</s>Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.</s>Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?</s>
He was a nice guy.</s>He was all right.</s>
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?</s>I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?</s>Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.</s>No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.</s>
I hate funny exit lines.</s>Who was the trunk addressed to?</s>
Daughter -- my daughter --</s>She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.</s>
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.</s>I want a second opinion.</s><u>This is an operations desk</u>.</s>I'm not asking.</s>
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...</s>... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...</s>... But we shouldn't have fired him...</s>... It's time to get this society back on track!</s>
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up!

I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias!</s>
Why are we going here? I hate this place.</s>It'll only take a second.</s>
Twenty-three, to be exact.</s>I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?</s>
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,</s>Who?</s>You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.</s>
You got five minutes.</s>Thank you.</s>
Like little children.  You okay?</s>Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.</s>I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?</s>I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.</s>Let's get away from the shore.</s>
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --</s>Bimboo?</s>Dad.</s>I just asked his name.</s>
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.</s>You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary?</s>
Step up here, Tyler.</s>Sir!</s>
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.</s>Jesus.</s>Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.</s>Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?</s>
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?</s>You tell me.  I only work here.</s>

Hello, again.</s>I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.</s>

Akina delutan, nou-shan.</s>...'Scuse me?</s>
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.</s>You admit to me you do not love your fiance?</s>He knows I do not love him.</s>"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.</s>I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.</s>
You missed somethin', Ed.</s>I did? I didn't see anything.</s>Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.</s>
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.</s>If you think you're getting past me...</s>
Isn't it about time you became something else?</s>I like it here...</s>
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....</s>There's nothing to be done about it.</s>I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.</s>Good. What else? Anything interesting?</s>Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.</s>
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.</s>I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.</s>Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!</s>Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?</s>You got my word on it.</s>
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.</s>Yeah?</s>I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.</s>That's... good?</s>Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.</s>I don't know if --</s>You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.</s>Of course.</s>Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.</s>
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.</s>An accident.</s>Shit!  Oh shit!</s>
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.</s>Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.</s>I told her all my relatives are good- looking.</s>
Is this what you killed them with?</s>You've been listening to rumors.</s>Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.</s>You are.  Now.</s>
How's everything?</s>Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.</s>Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.</s>Oh, yeah.</s>But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.</s>
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?</s>It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.</s>What did you think then?</s>I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.</s>Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?</s>Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?</s>Try to keep it to a minimum.</s>We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --</s>
You closed 'em today?</s>Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...</s>...yes...</s>...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.</s>That's right, Shel.</s>
Well what about the new Echo --</s>Do not get ahead of yourself.</s>
What about Maxine?</s>Fuck Maxine.</s>We wish.</s>
Mike?</s>What?</s>My ass if falling.</s>Your what...?</s>My ass is falling.  It is.</s>What are you talking about?</s>I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.</s>Get in bed.</s>What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...</s>You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.</s>
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.</s>So you think my mom was a slut too?</s>I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.</s>If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?</s>You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.</s>Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.</s>It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.</s>And you believe it?</s>Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.</s>
Tell me something, Skid --</s>Scud.</s>Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?</s>The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.</s>Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.</s>Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.</s>And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.</s>
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.</s>What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?</s>Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.</s>And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?</s>Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.</s>
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.</s>Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?</s>
We're not stupid, Reynolds.</s>The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?</s>This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?</s>You have any idea what kind of position this--</s>He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.</s>

How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.</s>If I may be so bold...</s>For the gods, spit it out!</s>Why not do it in the Colosseum?</s>
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.</s>Release the evil?</s>I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.</s>
I... remember.</s>You were ALL human!</s>
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.</s>But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.</s>

Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.</s>Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...</s>

Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.</s>Power you have given me. What can my power give you?</s>Knowledge.</s>Of what?</s>The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?</s>Why must you know?</s>There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.</s>You lie!</s>Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?</s>No.</s>A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.</s>Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.</s>
He's coming ain't he?</s>'Course he's coming.</s>
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.</s>Maybe I'll do that.</s>I'm sorry about Blake.</s>
So what do we do about this creep?</s>Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.</s>

Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.</s>What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?</s>
What?</s>Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.</s>And that makes you look like a squid?</s>I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!</s>
What do we do?</s>I was told to take what we have and go.</s>Go where?   The police are outside.</s>
I've got a lock!  There!</s>Come on!</s>
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"</s>But wasn't it funny?</s>"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...</s>

Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.</s>Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.</s>I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.</s>With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.</s>You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.</s>

It's a complicated subject.</s>It's a simple subject.</s>
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.</s>I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.

Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!</s>I'm coming, I'm coming.</s>

God bless you!</s>Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.</s>
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."</s>"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.</s>You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.</s>How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?</s>Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.</s>

How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?</s>You think you know what this money is?</s>Yes, I...</s>No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...</s>No, but you stole from them.</s>I made their lives better.</s>You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...</s>Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.</s>I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.</s>Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?</s>No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.</s>That's right, work it out.</s>No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.</s>Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.</s>I'm so ashamed dad.</s>Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...</s>You're right.</s>

Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.</s>You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?</s>This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.</s>Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.</s>
You miss her, huh?</s>No.  I've got you.</s>
Do I know you?</s>No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.</s>

Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?</s>I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?</s>I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.</s>
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.</s>Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.</s>That's what we said.</s>

I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.</s>Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.</s>I guess...</s>

Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?</s>It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.</s>
We finally graduated, big dude guy!</s>Alright!</s>
Go, Doctor.</s>What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.</s>The death of my father.</s>Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.</s>

So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.

Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?</s>Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.</s>You'll get your money.

Do you?</s>Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.</s>I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.</s>
I know it's soon to talk about it.</s>Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.</s>
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.</s>Whose side are you on anyway?</s>Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.</s>

Why not?</s>I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now.

We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat!

Untie that rope.</s>Please.  It's my job.</s>
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.</s>That is true.</s>
Find the feet?</s>No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.</s>We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?</s>We did find these, however.</s>

Let me tell him.  Let him decide.</s>You're not gonna see him again.</s>What... what makes you think you can order me around?!</s>Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?</s>
I hate that picture.</s>Where are they?</s>Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?</s>Where are they? Last chance.</s>Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?</s>

I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.</s>Krueger is reality.</s>And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!</s>What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??</s>
It's about to be a broken face.</s>This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.</s>
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.</s>Excellency, you are right.</s>
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...</s>It's not really a good time, guys...</s>
No!  You gave your word!</s>Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.</s>

Wait. Don't leave me.</s>You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.</s>

You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.</s>I don't know about that.</s>I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?</s>What, I don't know how you mean?</s>See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.</s>Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?</s>I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?</s>
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.</s>I demand action.</s>No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?</s>Can't you tell me anything?</s>It's going to be a long spring.</s>
Nice one.</s>Fuck off.</s>

Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.</s>I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.</s>
So, that's Ryan.</s>Looks like a flaming asshole to me.</s>
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?</s>I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.</s>
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?</s>She got me an abortion...</s>
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.</s>I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.</s>
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.</s>I should probably write that down.</s>Yeah.</s>
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.</s>It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.</s>How dare you talk to me in this manner?</s>
Hello.</s>Jacob Singer?</s>Speaking.</s>Paul Gruneger!</s>Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!</s>
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.</s>Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.</s>
Remember you asked me what state I was from?</s>Yes.</s>Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.</s>Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.</s>I guess that really does make me a hard case.</s>
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.</s>Well, gee, I try and have a heart.</s>Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.</s>This?</s>Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!</s>Oh!</s>Who did it? Now wait a minute.</s>Hickory!</s>Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.</s>
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?</s>He called me "Doc."</s>
Good evening, Miss.</s>How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?</s>I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.</s>How long would that take?</s>Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...</s>Immigration Officer?</s>Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...</s>
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?</s>In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.</s>

The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.</s>Did you ever report it to anyone?</s>Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.</s>Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.</s>

Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.</s>Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.

Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.

Can we take a dip?</s>Okay.</s>
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?</s>It depends on the condition of the ship.

Rosa, so you've met David?</s>Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!</s>Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.</s>
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...</s>...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.</s>All right, take it easy now, take it easy.</s>Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.

It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.</s>That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.</s>
What the hell is that for?</s>The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.</s>I don't --  Do that stuff.</s>Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.</s>Projecting joy is not my job.</s>Fine.

Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...</s>...What bar?</s>The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.</s>You ever seen this motherfucker before?</s>Who, Mr. White?</s>Yeah.</s>No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town.

And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.</s>
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.</s>Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.</s>

Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.</s>It's been a while.</s>No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.</s>

But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--</s>Yes Basil?</s>Be careful!</s>
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.</s>It wasn't petrol.</s>
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.</s>These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!</s>
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?</s>Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.</s>Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.</s>
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.</s>Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.</s>Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.</s>Oh la vache!</s>
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!</s>You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--</s>
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....</s>But I can throw it out of the window.</s>It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....</s>...but big.</s>...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?</s>Who cried that one?</s>Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.</s>Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary?

Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.</s>Does he speak English?</s>
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --</s>And they're changing into...</s>I don't really know.

How long?</s>At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --</s>What do you mean "complete"?</s>I wish I could tell you.

This must be very new.</s>Yeah.</s>It's so small.</s>What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?</s>I don't think so.</s>You don't have a computer in your cabin?</s>No.</s>How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?</s>Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.</s>Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!</s>That would knock my father out.</s>Yeah?</s>Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.</s>He's a Windows guy then, huh?</s>Yes. He likes windows.</s>Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?</s>...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.</s>True.</s>
You ever think about going back?</s>Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.</s>
Sure, why not.</s>It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?</s>It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?</s>We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?</s>That's what we agreed.</s>If you're unhappy with the arrangement --</s>I'm not unhappy.</s>If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --</s>Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?</s>I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.</s>I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.</s>I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.</s>
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.</s>Yeah, probably a good idea.</s>
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.</s>... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...</s>
Stop --</s>Tell me how.</s>
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.</s>Why should you do that?</s>If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.</s>You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.</s>What about all those ideas you had?</s>See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.</s>Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.</s>This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.</s>Check.</s>Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...</s>
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.</s>I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.</s>That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.</s>I didn't start this, R.L.</s>
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?</s>And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.</s>
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.</s>The door was open, so we let ourselves in.</s>
My God!  He's so excessive!</s>Where have you been?</s>
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.</s>Here.</s>Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.</s>I'm almost done making it.

I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.</s>I am.</s>Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?</s>

What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.</s>You got a problem with drilling, probie?</s>No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.</s>Roll the hose.</s>
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.</s>No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.</s>Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?</s>I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.</s>You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?</s>I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.</s>Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.</s>I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.</s>
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.</s>Where are your bills, Carl?</s>Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See?</s>Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.</s>
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.</s>The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--</s>
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.</s>Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.</s>I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?</s>It's, it's really nice, Paul.</s>
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?</s>He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.</s>
Bella -- this is Anna.</s>Right.</s>
Jill says nothing.</s>Where's your car?</s>A friend dropped me off.</s>Who?</s>Never mind. Where've you been?</s>A business meeting, I told you that.</s>
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.</s>They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.</s>You mind if I tag along?</s>
Hey, come on...</s>Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.</s>Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.</s>How about Teresa?  I could talk...</s>Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.</s>And say what?</s>I'll say that I'm travelling.</s>
He do that to you?</s>Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.</s>Pig.  What the hell happened this time?</s>
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.</s>How many?</s>Four of them.</s>

That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...</s>Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.</s>
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.</s>Aye, sir.</s>
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?</s>It wasn't exactly a lie.</s>
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.</s>Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.</s>
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...</s>Not now Bork.</s>
Hear him?</s>The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.</s>An old acquaintance, eh?</s>
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on!</s>Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.</s>

Please -- please!</s>You don't like to see me enjoying myself.</s>
Spock... don't.</s>It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.</s>
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.</s>The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?</s>
Bill, how do you do?</s>Pleased to meet you.</s>Pleasure to meet you.</s>
...Where is everything?</s>In the trunk.</s>
Vermin...</s>Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?</s>
You gonna work at The Kingdom?</s>Depends on big brother.</s>I'm a water-skier.</s>Are you really?</s>Sure am.</s>That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.</s>How come?</s>Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.</s>
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.</s>What's the time frame?</s>Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.</s>
There may be a hunting party.</s>Why, there's nothing on the news?</s>I didn't mean police.</s>
He waved to you?</s>I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.</s>You wave back?</s>I didn't have time.</s>I imagine you would've though.</s>
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?</s>I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.</s>Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.</s>Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?</s>I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.</s>
I hope everything goes all right.</s>I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?</s>Fine.  Wait.</s>
I fell out of my bed last night.</s>You slept too near where you got in?</s>I slept too near where I fell out.</s>You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.</s>
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.</s>It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.</s>
OH JESUS!</s>HELLLPPP!</s>
Where's the fire?</s>"Shreck's."  You --</s>
Do you hear that?</s>It's twelve o'clock.</s>It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?</s>That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.</s>I can't possibly think of a better reason.</s>It's false sentimentality.</s>You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?</s>
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.</s>It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?</s>Bright enough to be dangerous.</s>That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.</s>

Is Frank D'Angelo around?</s>At the bar - Sidney...</s>
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?</s>What are you talking about?</s>If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.</s>You're drunk --</s>I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.</s>
Got me an audition tonight.</s>Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?</s>

What do you think?</s>You fucked it?</s>
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?</s>You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-</s>I don't need to be lectured by you.

Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?</s>Yes.</s>Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?</s>Like cats and dogs.</s>What did they argue about?</s>You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.</s>Did they argue the day before he died?</s>Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.</s>What was the nature of the argument?</s>Sex.</s>Could you be more specific?</s>
Where you from?</s>What is this?</s>Not too good at small talk, eh?</s>Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.</s>I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.</s>
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-</s>Hello.</s>Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?</s>...Who is this?</s>Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.</s>
You sound like Peter Pan.</s>Remember -- open mind.</s>Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.</s>

Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.</s>Yeah.  She told me.</s>Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.</s>I heard.</s>I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.</s>It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.</s>You?</s>For calling you a homo.</s>That was out of line.</s>
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.</s>Just.</s>Buy you a drink, Maxine?</s>You married?</s>Yeah. But enough about me.</s>
I have more men.</s>I have smarter men.</s>
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--</s>Good-night, folks.</s>
So you're only invisible... to yourself?</s>No.</s>
Is that all?</s>Yeah... then I sighed... like this.</s>
"It's why the witch kills children."</s>I thought all witches were benign and good.</s>Not this one.</s>
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?</s>What I have to do.  Screw the annual.</s>
Is it about Jacqueline?</s>No. She's no longer under my care.</s>
It can't work.</s>He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.</s>He looks like a giant tea bag.</s>
This is weird, Mulder.</s>Very weird.</s>Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?</s>Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.</s>
What film?</s>Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.</s>
A mental case?</s>I'm sorry...</s>Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.</s>
Don't come back.</s>I won't...don't worry.</s>
Oh! Trim it!</s>I hate that.</s>Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.</s>No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.</s>Okay, so maybe later.</s>
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.</s>I'm afraid I don't...</s>This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.</s>
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...</s>Are you totally gone? This is my private home...</s>I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.</s>What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?</s>Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.</s>My son is sick, okay?</s>
He was sitting here?</s>It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.</s>
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.</s>You did that?</s>
He is dying. He knows it.</s>You are dying, too.</s>No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.</s>
My parents? What do you mean?</s>I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas.

Damage report!</s>Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.</s>We're out of control -- Rig for collision...</s>
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...</s>Freshman and sophomores...</s>You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.</s>Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.</s>
Mrs... Sutphin?</s>Right here!</s>
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes</s>I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow</s>Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?</s>Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah</s>

It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.</s>Please, Cotton, don’t do this.</s>
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?</s>He said - "I can smell your cunt."</s>I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?</s>Yes.</s>It's much better than your shoes.</s>Maybe they'll catch up.</s>I have no doubt of it.</s>Did you do those drawings, Doctor?</s>Yes.

Just a walk, for Chrissakes.</s>Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.</s>
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?</s>That's the way it's done.</s>And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?</s>All I want's the money.</s>Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.</s>
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --</s>I'll kill you!</s>

Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?</s>I'm not hungry, really.</s>
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.</s>You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.</s>Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.</s>You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.</s>
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.</s>Tension? KURTZ Suspense.</s>
Say something ...</s>Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.</s>I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?</s>He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.</s>How was I in the wrong?</s>
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.</s>Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.

Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.</s>Are you alright?</s>
That's hard to believe.</s>Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.</s>

I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...</s>...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...</s>
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.</s>Why?</s>Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!</s>
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?</s>Jesus, I don't believe it.</s>Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?</s>
Landon! Send a last signal.</s>What signal?</s>To Earth! That we've landed!</s>

The more the merrier.</s>Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.</s>
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?</s>What money?</s>The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.</s>Shylock?</s>
Why didn't she thank you?</s>She did... didn't she?</s>
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.</s>You hated West more than any of us.</s>Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --</s>You're the only one missing a grenade.</s>Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?</s>
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.</s>Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy.

You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?</s>I killed too many barbarians.</s>I'm a Greek, thank you.

So who won?</s>A triumph.  When did you get here?</s>Ten, fifteen minutes ago.</s>Why didn't you come in?</s>I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.</s>
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...</s>I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.</s>A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?</s>
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?</s>Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.</s>I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.</s>
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!</s>No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?</s>No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.</s>That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.</s>It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.</s>Hold on a minute.</s>
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.</s>Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.</s>
Don't count it...it's all there.</s>Count it.</s>Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.</s>
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?</s>I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.</s>
Is that supposed to be funny?</s>We don't think this place is safe.</s>This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.</s>
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!</s>No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.</s>
...Well then, that's how many I killed.</s>If you say so.</s>Damn right I do.</s>
Could I ask you a question?</s>Could I stop you?</s>You don't drink like you used to.</s>That's not a question.</s>I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.</s>Still not a question.</s>My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?</s>Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.</s>You think too much?</s>Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.</s>
Leave him alone.</s>He can't stay up there.</s>He'll come down. Leave him alone.</s>Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?</s>No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?</s>Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.</s>
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.</s>You're a comfort to me, Henry.</s>What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.</s>It's a letter to my father.</s>
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.</s>I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with.

I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?</s>There is no news big enough.</s>If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -</s>As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.</s>The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.</s>It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -</s>That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.</s>Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -</s>
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?</s>I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.</s>You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh?

Saavik, get us out, best speed!</s>Aye, sir.</s>
Who's this?</s>My wife.</s>Where is the little lady?</s>In heaven.</s>She's dead?</s>Yes, she is.</s>How'd she die?</s>Auto wreck.</s>Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?</s>No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.</s>Died instantly?</s>Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.</s>Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?</s>Yes, they do.</s>
We're all alone, aren't we?</s>Michael's around someplace...</s>
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.</s>I thought those seekers were set for stun!</s>That they are.</s>They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.</s>That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.</s>
What do I have to do?</s>I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.</s>I don't like flowers.</s>Oh.</s>How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.</s>Kay.</s>Okay.</s>
You have no right...</s>And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.</s>She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.</s>And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.</s>I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.</s>No, I think it's just the beginning.</s>
Amazing. I'm Johns.</s>Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...</s>
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.</s>Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.</s>Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!</s>

Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.</s>So what's the problem?</s>The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.</s>'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?</s>
What happened, Michael!?</s>Nanook...</s>What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!</s>Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!</s>
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --</s>Mr. Dobisch said that?</s>And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.</s>Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.</s>Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.</s>That's very flattering.</s>

You got a good lawyer?</s>Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.</s>Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?</s>
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--</s>-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?</s>He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.</s>Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?</s>
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.</s>Nick...</s>
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."</s>There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.</s>
Anyone?</s>Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.</s>Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...</s>
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.</s>Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...</s>NO!</s>

Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.</s>I wonder if that was the same copter.</s>
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.</s>Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.</s>
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!</s>They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.

And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...</s>

Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.</s>She's in a wheelchair?!</s>
What else?  Money.</s>It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.</s>But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.</s>Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.</s>Those 'fools' are my people.</s>Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.</s>
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.</s>I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.

Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.</s>Yes?</s>Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?</s>Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.</s>Oh.</s>Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?</s>Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.</s>Isn't the plumage beautiful?</s>I just say what the other person would say?</s>Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.</s>Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs.

Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?</s>The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!</s>Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?</s>No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train.

Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?</s>Yes.</s>I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -</s>That must have been love.</s>I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!

But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.</s>

Do you really believe your life is meaningless?</s>I don't know.

I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together.

Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.</s>How did you find out all that?</s>

I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?</s>Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.</s>How about letting the people out of the bank.

Professor, we need to talk.</s>What is it, Dwight?</s>I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.</s>What?</s>The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated.

Why are you ashamed?</s>Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything?

What is it exactly that you want to know?</s>I want to know why you are the way you are!</s>And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.</s>But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?</s>No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.</s>

One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.</s>Yes.</s>What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.</s>The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.</s>You're a considerate young man.</s>You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.</s>However I can help you...</s>The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.</s>We do favors for each other...</s>Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.</s>

Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?</s>I reckon not.</s>Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.</s>Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.</s>Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?</s>I've heard it said that way.</s>Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?</s>I wouldn't never hurt them.</s>That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?</s>
The turbine blew.</s>Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?</s>
Well, what have you thought?</s>Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.</s>
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.</s>Right.</s>Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--</s>
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?</s>I've been great. And you?</s>
I was going to take a swim.</s>I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.</s>Right.</s>
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!</s>I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --</s>
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!</s>Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.</s>
Lying?</s>Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...</s>...public drunkenness....</s>I didn't sell the boy any...</s>...beer.</s>Shut your mouth until I tell you...</s>...to talk, son.</s>You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."</s>Then how about if I call you "ass-...</s>
Would you like to come along?</s>We can't.</s>It's better than going to prison for heresy.</s>
You're not just after this girl, are you?</s>Who, me?</s>
A straight line.</s>Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...</s>
Will you give this to him.</s>If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.</s>
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?</s>What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.</s>
Who's the judge?</s>Corey.</s>Good.</s>
You're not going to play it again.</s>Well, lemme play the other side then.</s>No.</s>
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -</s>Why can't we?</s>I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.</s>
What do you think it is?</s>Depends who it's from.</s>Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.</s>You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.</s>What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?</s>Depends on the state.</s>Arizona.</s>Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?</s>
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?</s>Uh...</s>Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.</s>Yeah? What do you do with 'em?</s>
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?</s>I don't think that will be necessary.</s>
Goodnight.</s>Goodnight.</s>
When did you think it would happen?</s>I'm not sure.</s>I knew when I first met you.</s>Oh.</s>
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?</s>Mac.  What's shaking?</s>
He's shy, not like Enzo.</s>Yes.  Not like Enzo.</s>I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.</s>... I'm pregnant, Bonita!</s>
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?</s>Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.</s>
How about some ginger pie?</s>Eh, fine.</s>I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?</s>Oh, it's fine. Fine.</s>She seemed yare to me.</s>
My God, what happened here?</s>You feign ignorance?</s>WHAT HAPPENED?</s>You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!</s>
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.</s>Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.</s>Carter, would I lie to you?</s>
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?</s>Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...</s>
I don't think so--</s>Well--</s>
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.</s>How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.</s>Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?</s>
Why?</s>As part of his plan. I don't know why.</s>See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.</s>The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.</s>What does Starsky say?</s>He says. This is he.</s>This is he?</s>No. This is he.</s>
Now?</s>Now.  No, don't kill him.</s>
My fuckin' head.</s>Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.</s>

Fine speech. Now what do we do?</s>Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.</s>
From now on you'll be history</s>You'll be hist...</s>
Assume away!</s>Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.</s>What do you mean?</s>You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.</s>What did I do?</s>You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.</s>So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.</s>Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.</s>But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.</s>Exactly.  And how long did it run?</s>One night.</s>
Kick a buck.</s>Damn.</s>
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.</s>Mom.</s>One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'</s>They're all human beings</s>Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared</s>Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?</s>Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college</s>Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?</s>When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you</s>But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY</s>I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.</s>

Major, those are my boys out there dying.</s>Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?</s>
Don't tell Rowan about this.</s>Michael, Rowan should -</s>NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?</s>
Give me a ride?</s>Sure.</s>'Preciate it.</s>
Oh Jesus.</s>He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.</s>Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.</s>
What's wrong?</s>I forgot to lock the door.</s>
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--</s>Like what, Mr. Taylor?</s>Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--</s>Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--</s>But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--</s>What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?</s>Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.</s>
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.</s>What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.</s>
What's that got to do with it?</s>Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!</s>
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...</s>Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...</s>And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.</s>Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.</s>
How about some ammo?</s>It's loaded... I got some shells in here.</s>
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?</s>We're doing this together. We're partners.</s>Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.</s>
How long you going away for?</s>Long enough.</s>"For"...?</s>"To"... Forget about you.</s>
When were you in Niagara Falls?</s>About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.</s>
Martin -- your customer.</s>Can I help you?</s>
He doesn't look very threatening.</s>That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.</s>
CIA?</s>Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --</s>The phone company was broken up.</s>And you b-believe that.</s>
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?</s>Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?</s>
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.</s>I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.</s>You're wasting your time.</s>Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...</s>There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.</s>Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.</s>Same thing, isn't it?</s>No, it is NOT.</s>
Who'd you kill?</s>Four. But no one this important.</s>
You shot an eight year old girl.</s>Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.</s>The hell were you thinking?</s>Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.</s>Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.</s>
This is the Starship Enterprise.</s>A Federation starship.</s>This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.</s>Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?</s>
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?</s>Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.</s>So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?</s>Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?</s>So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.</s>She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.</s>Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?</s>David Ravell.</s>God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?</s>I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.</s>Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"</s>
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.</s>Well, you ARE!</s>
Good-bye, Adam.</s>Goodbye.</s>
Who's this fat man, then?</s>Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.</s>
He says it's a box.</s>Yeah, you're funny.</s>It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.</s>For real?  A treasure?</s>
Doctor!  What brings you here?</s>Just visiting my patient.</s>Really?  And how is his state of mind?</s>He's seriously disturbed...</s>
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.</s>I thought the subject was sex?</s>As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?</s>Yes.</s>How?</s>I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.</s>Why not?</s>Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.</s>Try.</s>
'You Will Anderson?</s>Who're you?</s>I'm Duff.</s>Wouldn't have known you.</s>Wouldn't have known you.</s>What's on your mind?</s>Nothing. Heard you were in town.</s>Wanted a look at your old man, huh?</s>Yeah. That's right.</s>
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.</s>Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.</s>

Why you shaking me off?</s>I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.</s>"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.</s>But he ain't seen my heat--</s>Awright, meat, give him your heat.</s>
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?</s>I don't think it would fit you.</s>I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.</s>It's very expensive.</s>

I love you too, Daddy.</s>Always keep 'em laughing.</s>
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?</s>As far as I know.</s>Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.</s>
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.</s>Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.</s>You don't look angry.</s>How do I look?</s>Beautiful.</s>
What is this? What color is it?</s>Blue. It's Blue Velvet.</s>
Shit</s>George...</s>
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--</s>You caught that, huh?</s>I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?</s>Well, I don't have no trousers on...</s>
I didn't do too well for you.</s>No, you did fine.</s>I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?</s>No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.</s>You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.</s>Yes... I... yes.</s>
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.</s>The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.</s>
You're out of your mind.</s>So you're gonna bitch up?</s>What's that supposed to be, psychology?</s>I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.</s>Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.</s>
Oh hi!</s>Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.</s>Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.</s>
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .</s>Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.</s>Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.</s>
You saved my life.</s>Did you think I could just leave you...?</s>

I assume Benes knows how to control it.</s>That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.</s>They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.</s>And take a little trip with them...</s>Trip? Where to?</s>Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --</s>You mean <I'm> going along?</s>As part of the Crew.</s>Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!</s>Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.</s>But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !</s>It's only for an hour --</s>Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.</s>
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?</s>Ugh ...</s>

Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.</s>My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.</s>
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?</s>It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.</s>
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?</s>Yeah. It's really good.</s>Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.</s>

No ...</s>But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.</s>No, and neither were my men.</s>Why?</s>Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.</s>That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...</s>To show them to the UN, right?</s>Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.</s>

Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.</s>So?</s>We'll see which way the wind blows.</s>

But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.</s>

Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.</s>
How'd you find this place?</s>Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.</s>
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.</s>Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?</s>Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...</s>
Back it down, Johnny!</s>I can go hotter!</s>
You're darned tootin'!</s>Ah, dammit!</s>
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.</s>She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.</s>
Well, I don't get it.</s>Huh? Get what?</s>Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.</s>Well?</s>Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?</s>Why—uh—</s>
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.</s>I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.</s>
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?</s>Not fooling around.</s>I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?</s>I see what you mean.</s>There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.</s>I know Frederick.</s>
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!</s>They outnumber us, my Lord --</s><U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!</s>
You okay?</s>Flesh wound.  No big deal.</s>
PARRTYY!</s>We're friends of Beckett's.</s>It's me, you dork.</s>
What does that do?</s>Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.</s>
I want children.</s>You've just decided, is that right?</s>Yes.</s>
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."</s>The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...</s>The penitent man. The penitent...</s>
From Hurley's?</s>Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?</s>
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!</s>You'd lose your security deposit?</s>Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...</s>
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.</s>Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.</s>
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?</s>Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.</s>
Who told them that?</s>I have no idea.</s>Why not?</s>I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.</s>
Ben?</s>Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?</s>Baby, you're scaring me.</s>
Any ghosts in here?</s>C'mon, cut it out.</s>Well, what am I supposed to do?</s>I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.</s>
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.</s>Don't taste bad.</s>And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...</s>That's right. And douse some in it.</s>
-- closed.</s>Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?</s>
And what are you doing?</s>Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.</s>A nap?</s>Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?</s>
Boys...</s>Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.</s>
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'</s>Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.</s>
Where's the Keymaster?</s>Oh, shit!</s>
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.</s>Anyone particular in mind?</s>You.</s>
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.</s>So I can have these?</s>Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!</s>
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.</s>But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...</s>No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.</s>
They need to run first and second?</s>Yeah, first and second.</s>
I have to talk to you.</s>Doug, this is Mr...</s>

I'll leave you two alone to talk.</s>Yeah, thanks a lot.</s>
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.</s>Thank you.</s>You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...</s>I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.</s>Yes, quite, but you should know that...</s>That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.</s>Yes... you will wait.</s>
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.</s>Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!</s>No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.</s>We start our own class?</s>Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.</s>
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!</s>Jerking off?</s>No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.</s>
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.</s>What about the customers with reservations?</s>Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.</s>
So what do you want me to do?</s>I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...</s>
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...</s>No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...</s>
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.</s>Don't make me sit through one of your plays.</s>Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.</s>Since when did that matter?</s>Let's not start that again.</s>My back is killing me.</s>Where's your elastic brace?</s>I can't find it.</s>You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.</s>I lost it. I lose everything.</s>I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.</s>
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?</s>No, I wouldn't...</s>Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.</s>
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-</s>Thank you so much.</s>Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?</s>Show me a human and I might have!</s>
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.</s>What book!</s>They'll find a way in.</s>
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --</s>Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.</s>
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.</s>Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.</s>
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...</s>I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...</s>Why?</s>Because she's my...my...</s>She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!</s>I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...</s>That don't make 'em kin...</s>All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.</s>How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...</s>
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.</s>That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?</s>
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.</s>Like cancer with a purpose.</s>Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --</s>
Higher.  Higher.</s>Higher.</s>Right, right.  Good.</s>
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.</s>Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.</s>
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.</s>Like heroin?</s>Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.</s>Like love?</s>Could be. The physical substance of love.</s>
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.</s>Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.</s>Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.</s>By reading my thoughts?</s>If necessary.</s>What if they're naughty?</s>
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.</s>The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.</s>
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.</s>Mr. Scott: as good as your word.</s>
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.</s>Well, you've got the rest of your lives.</s>
Sure. I can follow that.</s>It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?</s>Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?</s>Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.</s>Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?</s>
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.</s>But I like being human now.</s>
Rio de Janeiro!</s>Oh, no...Did you say Rio?</s>No. Yes?</s>
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.</s>You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.</s>
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?</s>No thanks.</s>
I'll deal with her later.</s>Good.  Because I'm fed up.</s>
It's bona fide!</s>He's a suitor!</s>
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.</s>I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.</s>
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?</s>Don't ask me, but he's on his way.</s>
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.</s>We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.</s>
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!</s>Let me alone.</s>You're crying, Animal.</s>It's that song, Harry!</s>You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!</s>There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!</s>
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.</s>I won't.</s>Get into bed.</s>I will.</s>
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.</s>Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.</s>I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."</s>A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.</s>He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!</s>
Go to sleep now.</s>I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.</s>What?</s>A story.</s>Like the one about the frog?</s>And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.</s>When I was a child...</s>Yeah?</s>I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...</s>What does that mean?</s>
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.</s>What's he doing?</s>He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.</s>Did you tell him you were leaving?</s>I told him I might.</s>
How did you know it was her?</s>I can smell her perfume.</s>
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.</s>What? He's going to be all right!</s>Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.</s>Well, make it stop!</s>His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.</s>You know who I work for.</s>
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.</s>Nice of you to come.</s>No. Frank was a good bloke.</s>
She wanted something to help her sleep.</s>Mary, we really have to go.</s>
Yes?</s>We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.</s>
Eto Akta Gamat!</s>I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...</s>
I'll deal with you later.</s>Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.</s>
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.</s>I'll check it.</s>
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.</s>Poison gas...</s>
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.</s>I was wrong.</s>
How much do you remember?</s>It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.</s>
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.</s>Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.</s>You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.</s>
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.</s>Is Mae Rose okay?</s>She's doing just fine.</s>And the baby?</s>He's a big one.</s>It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.</s>
I'll go.</s>Wrong.</s>What, vou?</s>I'm not the chemical weapons expert.</s>
You love me now, don't you?</s>Very much.</s>
Thanks for sharing.</s>We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.</s>If you do anything to my friend...</s>Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.</s>
That's impossible.</s>It's a miracle.</s>
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!</s>I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.</s>
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..</s>Dignity...</s>Yeah...</s>
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.</s>Quiet, Mother.</s>
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?</s>The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?</s>No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.</s>
What is that?</s>Real man' drink.</s>
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.</s>He doesn't give a damn about me.</s>Oh, you're wrong. He told me --</s>He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.</s>
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.</s>I wish to... go back to the way I was.</s>More lies.</s>
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.</s>The man in jail is always for freedom.</s>
Well, she's back.</s>What time is it?</s>Quarter of twelve.</s>Is she all right?</s>I don't see any bruises or broken bones.</s>
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!</s>They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.</s>That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.</s>
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.</s>There has to be!</s>There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.</s>
I mean, you think I'm that happy?</s>No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.</s>We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...</s>
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.</s>Good for you.</s>
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?</s>No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.</s>
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.</s>Bandit II?</s>
Is that Bandit in the lead?</s>If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.</s>I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.</s>Then it must be a helluva idea.</s>
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...</s>Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.</s>Impossible.</s>
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.</s>Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?</s>
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"</s>Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.</s>That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.</s>All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.</s>Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.</s>Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.</s>Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.</s>
Wait. When are you going to tell them?</s>Tell them? About...</s>Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?</s>Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.</s>Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!</s>It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.</s>Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...</s>
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?</s>Not if you take an advance on your credit card.</s>
Chase me!</s>For what purpose?</s>Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.</s>But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...</s>Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?</s>Androids... don't have...fun.</s>Why not...?</s>No one's ever asked me that before.</s>If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...</s>
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.</s>What?</s>This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.</s>You don't trust me?</s>I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.</s>
Well, nothing.</s>Now what?</s>Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.</s>But you said we could be together.</s>Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.</s>What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.</s><u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.</s>He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.</s>The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.</s>But I want to say with you,</s>Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.</s>I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?</s>I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.</s>
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!</s>Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...</s>
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?</s>Yeah.</s>Call me sometime.</s>
The curse drove you to gather this?</s>Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.</s>
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?</s>I will let down the steps for your honor.</s>
I'm just going to my room.</s>You're a guest here?</s>I'm -- I'm with a friend.</s>And who is that?</s>I... Edward...</s>
You'll miss the battle of the century!</s>Good. My heart can't take it.</s>Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.</s>
You shouldn't have.</s>Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.</s>There is one more thing.</s>
You think that's a good idea?</s>What do you mean?</s>Look at that place. It's creepy.</s>
I'm tired of living on the fringe.</s>But you used to say --</s>Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.</s>
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...</s>Recruit us to do what?</s>
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --</s>I didn't do anything --</s>
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.</s>We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.</s>My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.</s>The money was sent.</s>Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.</s>I wouldn't consider anyone else.</s>Except the President of the United States.</s>
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.</s>Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.</s>
I'm not!</s>Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!</s>But I want to. I'm trying!</s>I need an incendiary! An arsonist!</s>Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!</s>Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.</s>
To our assignment.</s>What is it you need me to do?</s>Helen, I want you to be my wife.</s>I'm married!</s>Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.</s>We're going to Paris?</s>Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.</s>I don't know.  I have to think...</s>Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.</s>
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.</s>No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.</s>Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?</s>It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!</s>
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.</s>You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?</s>At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.</s>Amen to that.</s>
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.</s>And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?</s>
FUCK.</s>What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?</s>There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!</s>Huh?</s>We throw the money out of the moving car!</s>
Let's go to my place.</s>Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.</s>
Harder.  Take the towel off.</s>Jack! Enough!</s>Go ahead.</s>
You rest now.</s>So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.</s>I'll be back later.</s>
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.</s>You ain't going in alone?</s>That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..</s>
You said...</s>I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.</s>Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.</s>I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.</s>Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?</s>
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.</s>Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.</s>A car?  You're going to buy a car?</s>
Shirelles.</s>You know that song?</s>
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.</s>Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?</s>A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.</s>But it's impossible.</s>Is it?</s>
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.</s>I just want to be a superhero.</s>That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.</s>
I put up new drapes, Jake.</s>I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?</s>You never said anything.  About the drapes.</s>They look nice.</s>You haven't even looked at them once.</s>
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...</s>Give me a chance --</s>
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?</s>They thought it was a publicity stunt.</s>Oh my God. How could it happen?</s>They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.</s>It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.</s>
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.</s>I'll go.</s>
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?</s>I'm doing okay, sir.</s>No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.</s>
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.</s>I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...</s>I never said...</s>...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.</s>
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.</s>Mom.</s>
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!</s>So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.</s>
What are you doing?</s>I'm coming with you.</s>No, you're not.</s>No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.</s>
Looking good out there.</s>Thanks.</s>I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.</s>I thought it had a lot of merit.</s>In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...</s>Rejected, worthless, miserable.</s>Yeah. Like that.</s>Good.</s>
Shall we give it a name?</s>Dave.</s>
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.</s>Yeah.  I better get on with my work.</s>
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.</s>How can that be? He was getting better.</s>He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.</s>He was tough. You did all you could.</s>I'm sorry.</s>You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.</s>
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.</s>Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.</s>
Where's Bubba?</s>Maybe he isn't showing.</s>
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?</s>Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.</s>There's no hurry! The race is over!</s>Not for me.</s>
Perhaps you could remind me.</s>I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?</s>
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.</s>Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?</s>
I could die.</s>So could I.</s>
Well, thank you. And thank them.</s>Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.</s>That's true, Mr. Simms.</s>We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.</s>Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.</s>Happy to see you looking so good.</s>
What are you doing?</s>Cover...our footsteps...</s>

I'll take a half hour.</s>Do you have any particular choice of girl?</s>You'll be fine.</s>
Yeah.</s>Would you take him?</s>
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?</s>No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?</s>
You stupid cunt!</s>You goddamn bitch!</s>
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?</s>Should I be?</s>What’s a French private investigator doing here?</s>Can I get up now?</s>No! What do you want here? How do you know me?</s>As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.</s>...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.</s>Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.</s>You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.</s>Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.</s>You-you’re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I’m in London. That’s all.</s>
What did he say?</s>It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!</s>Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?</s>
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?</s>I'd like to make a swap.</s>What for?</s>The piano.</s>The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?</s>
Like keeping her home from school?</s>Yes.</s>Listening to angels?</s>She drank too much. That's what killed her.</s>Do you know what she did to her?</s>I don't think I care to know.</s>She molested her!</s>Oh, dear God.</s>There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.</s>Oh God, if only I'd known.</s>Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.</s>I knew that after the fact.</s>Why didn't you do anything to stop her?</s>Because I didn't know...</s>Oh, God.</s>
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.</s>I'm Josephine.  Sax.</s>

Who told you...?</s>Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.</s>Moss...Who told him?</s>How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.</s>
Thanks, honey.</s>Good night, Sugar.</s>
Lyla's very nice.</s>Yes, she is.</s>She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.</s>She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?</s>Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...</s>Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.</s>You told me that two hours ago.</s>
How bad is it?</s>Nothing for you to worry about, darling</s>Pops</s>

Listen, you don't havta come?</s>Hey ..</s>
Then she said -- she loves me.</s>Oh shit dude, the L-word!</s>
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.</s>He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?</s>
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.</s>That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.</s>
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.</s>Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --</s>
...look down in pity...</s>You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!</s>
You ought to write these stories down.</s>Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.</s>"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?</s>I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.</s>Why, do you think?</s>I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.</s>You sound like an artist.</s>No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.</s>I don't think you're normal.</s>
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.</s>We go through the wall?</s>
Take this.</s>And do what with it?</s>

This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?</s>I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.</s>

Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?</s>They are at the gates of Paris, sire.</s>And where is the army?</s>It is on this road, sire, following me.</s>And who is defending Paris?</s>Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.</s>Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.</s>Unhappily, it is true, sire.</s>But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?</s>The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.</s>
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.</s>He can't take much more time on the table.</s>So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.</s>

Are we leaving?</s>It's too light yet.</s>
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.</s>And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.</s>
What do you mean, demons?</s>He told me he was going to Hell.</s>
A dirty frame!</s>Emma!</s>
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...</s>No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.</s>
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.</s>How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?</s>It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.</s>Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.</s>He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.</s>Signs?</s>Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.</s>
Those yours too?</s>My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.</s>

Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption...

Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.</s>Piss off.</s>You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.</s>

When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.</s>Why would you lose me?</s>The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk.

Where are they?</s>You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.</s>Where are they?</s>Don't worry.

The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...</s>You leave me no choice.</s>Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?</s>I will have to face the consequences, but so will you.

He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.</s>

So, I will challenge them and they will come together.</s>Yes sir.</s>You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.</s>

That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.</s>Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.</s>So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.</s>You gotta idea, spit it out.</s>Joe could help him.

So, what did you do?</s>I molested little girls.</s>Molested little girls?</s>Yeah.</s>

I've owned that little sucker for a long time.</s>I didn't know you took pictures.</s>I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.</s>So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.</s>That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.</s>How'd you get started?</s>Taking pictures?

Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?</s>It means nothing.</s>
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.</s>Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.</s>
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?</s>There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.</s>Would you remember his name?</s>Carl Smith.</s>
Now you're being bright?</s>Thank you, sir.</s>

Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.

Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?</s>The bitch shot me, is what happened.</s>
Yes.  Like that.</s>This an accident, Walter?</s>If you want it to be...</s>
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.</s>"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time.

"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.</s>I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.</s>That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.</s>"Was?"</s>We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.</s>You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.</s>Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.</s>How long ago?</s>Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.</s>You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."</s>I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.</s>What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?</s>It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.</s>
Dad!</s>What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?</s>Mommy.</s>I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -</s>Oh, no, please, please.</s>

You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --</s>Don't you ever stop talking?</s>
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.</s>How can it be the right thing if we're not together?</s>I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.</s>So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!</s>East coast people are different.</s>Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --</s>I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.</s>I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?</s>
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.</s>Sure.</s>

Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.</s>Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...</s>
I don't understand-</s>Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?</s>I didn't say anything-</s>Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.</s>I can't write anything by tomorrow.</s>Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.</s>Well what do I tell him?</s>

The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.</s>How 'bout a glass of water?</s>Rocky, d'ya know what I done?</s>...What?</s>I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.</s>Ya got a good mind for dates.</s>
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.</s>Thanks, uh, Lilly.</s>Don't mention it.</s>I guess I owe you my life.</s>You always did.</s>

Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.</s>Nice to meet you.</s>
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?</s>Calm down, Dave, what?</s>I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.</s>What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.</s>You think your investigation's been all that secret?

Make yourself right at home.</s>Where is my wife?</s>There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.</s>You lie!</s>
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.</s>This is madness, Wynn.</s>Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.</s>It was you.</s>Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.</s>Why did you take Jamie?</s>She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.</s>Jamie's baby ...</s>There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.</s>Samhain.</s>And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.</s>
Who you calling?</s>Shhh... Hello, room service?</s>C'mon, man...</s>Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long?

On my fucking room.</s>Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.</s>Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.</s>Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?</s>Don't worry about it. Just be smart.</s>But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.</s>Oh really. Why's that?</s>We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.</s>Who's gonna smell me a mile away?</s>Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.</s>
Is there a problem?</s>No.  No problem.  The airport, right?</s>Right.</s>

Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?</s>It's regulations.</s>She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --</s>Aren't you?</s>It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --</s>Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?</s>
Just out.</s>"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...</s>I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?</s>
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?</s>What?</s>He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.</s>
Your Honor—</s>Yes?</s>I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.</s>Take the stand!</s>
Uh, we should be getting to class now.</s>Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.</s>
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.</s>I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.</s>I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.</s>What's a toby?</s>You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.</s>I thought you weren't old fashioned.</s>In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.</s>
How long have you been married?</s>Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.</s>So you decided to go to America.</s>Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.</s>Yes, I'll bet.</s>He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.</s>Does he know that?</s>Oh, yes.</s>And he is still willing to give you a visa?</s>Yes, Monsieur.</s>And you want to know --</s>-- Will he keep his word?</s>He always has.</s>
What are you doing?</s>Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?</s>
What time have you, Gaston?</s>Eight forty-two, sir.</s>I guess it is eight forty-two.</s>You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.</s>I am, Gaston.</s>If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.</s>Have you?</s>Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.</s>And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.</s>Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.</s>Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!</s>May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.</s>I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?</s>No, sir.</s>Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?</s>No, sir.</s>Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?</s>Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.</s>
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?</s>I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?</s>I am through fucking around!

Bourbon. Neat.</s>I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.</s>
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?</s>It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.</s>

They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.</s>
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.</s>And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?</s>I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.</s>
I said no touching.</s>Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --</s>Get your hands off of her.</s>Dude, listen, man. I'm cool.

Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .</s>I never played tennis.

Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.</s>You're an interior decorator, right?</s>Sally did all this herself?</s>In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.</s>Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.</s>Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.</s>Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.

And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.</s>And you know, he really does not.</s>And Ryan works at home.</s>And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.</s>

Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.</s>I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.</s>But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.</s>
Delivery!</s>Hold on.</s>
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.

You sure you don't know nothing about this?</s>'Fraid not.</s>
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.</s>Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.

We can't get married at all.</s>Why not?</s>Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.</s>It doesn't matter.</s>And I smoke. I smoke all the time.</s>I don't care.</s>And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.</s>I forgive you.</s>And I can never have children.</s>We'll adopt some.</s>But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!</s>Well - nobody's perfect.</s>

He translated it wrong.</s>What?</s>
Let me guess--breakfast is served?</s>No.</s>What then?</s>I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.</s>That's what you're supposed to say.</s>This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.</s>You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!</s>I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.</s>It couldn't!</s>I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.</s>Fish can't feel.</s>Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.</s>Such as?...</s>The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.</s>Tell me about its sexual roots.</s>It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.</s>I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.</s>Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.</s>Go on.</s>And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.</s>You learned this in some college course?</s>I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.</s>The doctor.</s>Yes.</s>And what is his most cherished possession?</s>His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.</s>And he keeps it in his apartment?</s>Yes.</s>And no one's there now?</s>I don't think so.</s>That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.</s>What are you going to do?</s>He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.</s>No you're not!</s>Why not?</s>Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.</s>
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?</s>I don't know...</s>
He can still make it.</s>I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...</s>
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?</s>No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.</s>
38.</s>This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.</s>
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.</s>Yeah?</s>Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.</s>What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?</s>Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.</s>
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.</s>You might be right.</s>Why are you smiling so?</s>
Back where?</s>That's the idea.</s>
Something on your mind?</s>No.</s>
How much?</s>I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.</s>You think it's that good?</s>I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.</s>Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?</s>
I have a map.</s>Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--</s>--You never had a camera in my head.</s>
I'm not sure I understand.</s>Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.</s>
We keep in radio contact.</s>You've been listening in the whole time?</s>You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.</s>

If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?</s>I'm not very bright, I guess.</s>I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.</s>No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.</s>Then why did you take this job?</s>I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.</s>Afford it?</s>Have you ever been with a male band?</s>Me?</s>That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!</s>Rough?</s>I'll say.</s>You can't trust those guys.</s>I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!</s>Bingo?</s>You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.</s>Really?</s>Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.</s>That so?</s>Every time!</s>You know - I play tenor sax.</s>But you're a girl, thank goodness.</s>Yeah.</s>That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.</s>Yeah.</s>You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -</s>You don't say?</s>Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.</s>Men!</s>So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.</s>Brains aren't everything.</s>I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.</s>
Still, please.</s>Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.</s>Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...</s>
Are you a Secret Service Man?</s>Why do you ask?</s>I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.</s>

Ask me what I want to change about this moment.</s>What do you want to change about this moment?</s>Nothing.</s>
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?</s>Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!</s>Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.</s>People say that?</s>Forget it.  I was joking.</s>
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.</s>Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.</s>You said it, mister.  I gotta go.</s>
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?</s>Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.</s>
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.</s>Don't move.</s>Sorry.</s>
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.</s>But, sir...</s>There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.</s>Goddamn it, sir...</s>That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.</s>

Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?</s>Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.</s>Strange voices, Rose?</s>Yes, sir.</s>Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep.

We really must go, Mr. President.</s>Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.</s>
Yes.</s>So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?</s>I don't know.</s>But you want to.</s>
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.

Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?</s>Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.</s>
No!</s>Martini out!</s>
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.</s>I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.</s>
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.</s>But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.</s>Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?</s>
Who asked him here?</s>Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.</s>
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?</s>Yes!</s>And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!</s>Your accident...</s>Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?</s>I don't know... Switzerland?</s>We'll find him.</s>

You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -</s>Twenty-four.</s>Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.</s>There are none of them any good anyway.</s>And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...</s>
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?</s>It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.</s>Then why the hell do we watch all the time?</s>Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.</s>
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.</s>Della?</s>You want to see me? Well, here I am.</s>I see.</s>What do you want?</s>Just to see you. That's all.</s>Well, how do I look?</s>Like Della.</s>

He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.</s>Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?</s>I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.</s>You weren't looking for company, were you?</s>No.</s>Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?</s>No.  I don't even know why I do it.</s>Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?</s>I'll never get close to anybody.</s>Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.</s>You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!

After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.</s>I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?</s>Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-</s>I'm not enough for a paragraph.</s>- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know.

Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it.

That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water.

I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.</s>...Gordon.</s>Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.</s>
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.</s>Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?</s>No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.</s>Hmm.</s>Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?</s>Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.</s>Even if you don't think it's real?</s>I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.</s>What would you do?</s>We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.</s>I don't know. I barely made it today.</s>I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.</s>

I love Janis.</s>You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.</s>She OD'd, didn't she?</s>Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.</s>You mean she got a bad batch?</s>That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.</s>So he really loved her?</s>Uh-huh.</s>

It was a random thing.</s>I never bought that.</s>Oh?</s>Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.</s>

And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.</s>

I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!</s>Thank you, sir.</s>My wife... Alex freezes.</s>... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.</s>Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?</s>No. She's dead!</s>I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.</s>She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.</s>I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me?

But give me just one lousy hour.</s>Well - you'd need a body.</s>
Hey, thanks for comin' out.</s>Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.</s>
Sit over there, will you?</s>Me sir?</s>Yes.</s>
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?</s>He's pretty laid back, confident.</s>He remind you of that guy, Tillman?</s>Not at all.</s>But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.</s>I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.</s>Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.</s>My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.</s>You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.</s>Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.</s>Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.</s>
Not too hard, is it?</s>Maybe we've been pretty dumb--</s>There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.</s>
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.</s>Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...</s>
Since when is she an "actress"?</s>I know, she needs to die immediately.</s>
Might be a good time to try using it again.</s>Anybody else have a key to the house.</s>
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.</s>She's watching the car again?</s>Yeah.</s>I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.</s>
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey.

Where the hell we going to get us a football team?</s>All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...</s>
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?</s>Alright!  Alright... put me down...</s>
You alright?</s>Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.</s>

I'll tell you.</s>You'll do more.than that.</s>
I beg your pardon?</s>But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.</s>
I think about that night a lot...</s>Me, too. Every time I walk...</s>How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...</s>
People get hurt.</s>But it was an accident. The house was under construction.</s>People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.</s>But you were punished.</s>Yes. I went to jail.</s>Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?</s>They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.</s>What did you want for Christmas that year?</s>Hungry Hungry Hippos.</s>How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?</s>Regret.</s>What else makes you feel regret?</s>That I did it again.</s>You've done it again?</s>Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.</s>Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?</s>
[What money?]</s>[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]</s>[Who's Tazinari?]</s>[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]</s>

Don't sneak up on me...</s>Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...</s>Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.</s>

It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.</s>Mama, what's...</s>Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.</s>You're taking me home!</s>
Why haven't they brought us in yet?</s>I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.</s>
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.</s>I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.</s>What did your wife get her?</s>We got the same thing.</s>
Nurse.</s>Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all</s>
What the hell are you doing?</s>What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.</s>No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?</s>No. I should have.

You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.</s>Press a button and they give us money.</s>Ride with me. We need a haircut.</s>
Well?</s>It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.</s>This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...</s>Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?</s>If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...</s>But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...</s>Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...</s>

Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?</s>Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."</s>Of course!</s>

Cute cat. What's his name.</s>Peptic ulcer.</s>
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.</s>Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.</s>
Funny, huh?</s>What?</s>Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?</s>
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.</s>To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.</s>
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...</s>Scared of a girl?</s>Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??</s>

It's you.</s>It's me?</s>The one in the street.  I chased after you.</s>
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.</s>Oh really?</s>Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?</s>
They're waiting. Come on.</s>I can't. It's all too much.</s>Go on. You can do it.</s>
Hello.</s>It's me.</s>I figured it was.  Where are you?</s>I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later.

I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.</s>Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.</s>Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?</s>Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.</s>
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!</s>Lewis...</s>

I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.</s>Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?</s>General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.</s>Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!</s>
But the child --</s>Never mind! Hurry!</s>

According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.</s>Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?</s>I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.</s>Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?</s>It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.</s>No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.</s>

I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.</s>No -- not yet.</s>But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?</s>Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?</s>
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...</s>Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.</s>I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--</s>

The habeus corpus is thickening.</s>Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.</s>How do you know that?</s>Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.</s>

Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys.

Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings.

Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...</s>Let's try ...</s>
About?</s>Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --</s>

We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.</s>Who's Sophie?</s>Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.</s>

Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --</s>Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --</s>
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.</s>Do I have to pay juice?</s>
Police officer.</s>You're like an undercover guy!</s>You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.</s>Huh?!!!</s>Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?</s>
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.</s>Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?</s>
Who are you calling?</s>Mrs. Christian.</s>What?</s>She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.</s>Tom... she's dead.</s>
Hey, boss.</s>Just the man I wanted to see!</s>Turn on the T.V.</s>I did. isn't it neat-o?</s>Uh...what channel were you watching?</s>What are you talking about, fella?</s>
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.</s>But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.</s>Really?</s>Yeah, you don't remember?</s>
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.</s>Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.</s>
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.</s>Mom, take it easy.</s>
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...</s>This way, Mister McMurphy.</s>Yes, ma'am...</s>
...Glad you came man.</s>Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.</s>Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.</s>
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?</s>Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.</s>
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?</s>Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?</s>Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?</s>I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?</s>Really?</s>
Oh. Have a good day at school.</s>Okay.</s>
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..</s>Don't thank me. Thank Margie.</s>
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...</s>Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...</s>... I'm partial to the tight end.</s>This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...</s>
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.</s>Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.</s>
It could be nothing.</s>But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.</s>
You're in Oklahoma?!</s>Not yet.</s>Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.</s>Can't it go to any office?</s>No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.</s>
What a nice place.</s>Yeah, the tree makes it nice.</s>And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.</s>It's your play.</s>
That crazy sumbitch made it.</s>Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.</s>
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.</s>Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.</s>
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.</s>Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...</s>French?</s>Yes sir.</s>French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!</s>
Wish I could take the credit, but --</s>-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.</s>He must've beaten us all here!</s>
You lost my money?</s>You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.</s>Who is Friedman?</s>The man who sold the boy to your brother.</s>I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.</s>Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.</s>
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.</s>The dishes are juiced up, too.</s>Thank God.</s>Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.</s>They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.</s>He doesn't know about the Day Care.</s>Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?</s>Yeah, that's old, in a tree.</s>Oh.</s>Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?</s>
What's your point?</s>No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.</s>I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?</s>
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.</s>Don't be too long.</s>
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.</s>Absolutely not.</s>Toss you for it.</s>I don't gamble.</s>
She's not!</s>Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?</s>
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?</s>Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.</s>
All right, let's see the buzzer.</s>What's a buzzer?</s>So you're not a cop.</s>Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?</s>Who told you my name?</s>I've got good ears.</s>
I remember you.</s>I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.</s>
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.</s>Sorry, I just didn't remember.</s>
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.</s>I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --</s>
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?</s>No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.</s>
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.</s>I will if I can, Frank.</s>Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?</s>True.</s>Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?</s>That's true.</s>
What happened to your hand?</s>Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.</s>I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.</s>Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?</s>What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?</s>Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?</s>It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.</s>And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!</s>
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.</s>And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.</s>
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.</s>We've only just read about it in the morning papers.</s>Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?</s>
Hi dad.</s>Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?</s>I'm fine dad.</s>Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.</s>Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --</s>Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...</s>
You heard the news.</s>I hear Twombley got shot.</s>Yeah.</s>
We're missing the Sig Ep party.</s>No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.</s>No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.</s>
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?</s>No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!</s>Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --</s>Why is it -- breaking up?</s>I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --</s>
Four men. Babylon soldiers.</s>Can you walk?</s>

Let me do it, Hoffy.</s>You want to go?</s>No. I want to draw.</s>
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.</s>Thank you.</s>You have something for me?</s>
Mainly I work out of Boston.</s>Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?</s>Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.</s>Harvard?</s>You bet.</s>Did you study under Kim Greene?</s>Among others.</s>Kim and I are close friends!</s>Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.</s>You mean him.</s>
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.</s>And the experiment is in here?</s>
Well done, lad.</s>Three cheers for our champion.</s>
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.</s>So they're Jews. . .</s>This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.</s>Christ.</s>Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--</s>What does this have to do with--?</s>Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.</s>What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!</s>
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.</s>Very big.</s>I opened thousands of brains.</s>What did you find?</s>Big mess every time.</s>I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.</s>
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.</s>Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.</s>
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.</s>I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.</s>No porters here!!</s>No.</s>
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.</s>Who?</s>Those fucking Mob assholes.</s>
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.</s>I won't again.</s>
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.</s>I see. I thank you for your time.</s>
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?</s>For our sake, I hope not.</s>
AAAAAAAAAAAA !</s>Cover us, Ace !</s>
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?</s>The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.</s>And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?</s>

Oh my God...</s>Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"</s>Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.</s>
What happened next?</s>While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.</s>What happened?</s>There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.</s>
You thought we were a different planet?!</s>No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...</s>Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'</s>We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.</s>You did? That's funny. So did we.</s>Yes?</s>Yes.</s>We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...</s>The captain...</s>The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.</s>Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?</s>I don't understand 'friend.'</s>A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...</s>He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.</s>The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.</s>I understand.</s>Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.</s>What is hell?</s>It's bad.</s>He will.</s>
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.</s>Why don't we just tow it in?</s>We will. There's something I've got to find out.</s>Be careful, for chrissake.</s>

Give me a bottle of beer.</s>Right.</s>
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?</s>Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.</s>
Roach, what are you doing?</s>R-U-S-H Intensely.</s>

The oscilloscope's already programmed.</s>It's no good without the argon gas.</s>
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?</s>You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--</s>
No!  I won't let it happen...</s>You've freed me, Jack...</s>It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.</s>No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...</s>What?</s>Sunlight... It destroys him.</s>Sunlight?</s>That's why he goes masked during the day...</s>So, he's hiding in the dark...</s>In the dark... where I join him...</s>No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!</s>And I... love you...</s>
Enjoy your flight to Washington --</s>Wait --</s>What.</s>

Is THAT Odin?</s>You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.</s>Odin!</s>
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?</s>It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.</s>How?</s>He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.</s>I don't understand.</s>I still don't either, even after all these years.</s>
I want to secure it.</s>Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?</s>
Betty Elms?</s>Yes.</s>I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.</s>Very pleased to meet you.</s>Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.</s>
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?</s>I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?</s>
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?</s>They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.</s>Is it for a child?</s>
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.</s>No thanks. I'm fine without them.</s>Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.</s>
You think he saw us?</s>Who knows, baby?</s>He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?</s>Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.</s>

I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.</s>Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...</s>Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.</s>
What is it, son?</s>Two more hogs got the fever.</s>
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.</s>You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.</s>Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.</s>
Thanks for taking care of this for me.</s>Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.</s>
All right.  Let's get out of here.</s>The soldiers are going to kill those people!</s>
I don't know about this.</s>I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?</s>No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?</s>I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.</s>Me?</s>
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.</s>Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.</s>Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.</s>Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.</s>Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?</s>I don't want everyone to see.</s>Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?</s>How come that's all you talk about anymore ?</s>It's all I think about anymore.</s>
It's probably going to need stitches.</s>I'm going to throw up.</s>No, you're not.</s>
Can you?</s>Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.</s>You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.</s>
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?</s>Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...</s>Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am.</s>Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?</s>No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.</s>
Good god, boy! Yell!</s>Yawp!</s>Again!  Louder!</s>YAWP!</s>LOUDER!</s>AHHHHHH!</s>All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!</s>
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.</s>I like it up here.</s>Must get lonely being up here so much.</s>I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...</s>...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...</s>...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...</s>You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...</s>You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...</s>Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.</s>They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...</s>
Oh my God...we’re buried alive...</s>We’re alright.</s>
I just don't think it would work.</s>Why wouldn't it?</s>
They wrong?</s>No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.</s>You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?</s>
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.</s>All right... elevate me!</s>
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.</s>I just saw Joe.  He's here.</s>Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.</s>
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.</s>Nah, let's just take a look-see.</s>
Fuck is up?!</s>Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge?</s>
Are these not the answers you came for?</s>Yes... My God...</s>A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --</s>Lestat! You knew Lestat!</s>Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.</s>
Did they...?</s>You understand?</s>Did they catch...?</s>Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.</s>
You investigating those murders out at the lake?</s>Ww... uh...</s>Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.</s>
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?</s>Thanks.</s>Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.</s>
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.</s>Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.</s>
Mr. Scott?</s>I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.</s>Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!</s>
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.</s>I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.</s>
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?</s>Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.</s>If you get it?</s>Yeah.</s>You might not kill it.</s>You think so.</s>You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.</s>You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.</s>Mmm.</s>You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.</s>I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.</s>And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.</s>Wonderful!</s>
What on earth?</s>Any ideas?</s>Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...</s>Is that written in his shoe?</s>Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...</s>She had this in her mouth. There, there...</s>
I feel like a jerk.</s>Shhh.  Just concentrate.</s>
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".</s>Just a routine inspection tour.</s>The British worry so about their Empire -- it makes us feel like well- cared-for children.</s>
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.</s>You mean we're moving in?</s>
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!</s>Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.</s>It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.</s>So I understand.</s>Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?</s>You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...</s>A man should be upright, not be kept upright.

I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.</s>You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.</s>It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.</s>You're saying life will take care of Diego?</s>Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.</s>I get it.

Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.</s>I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.</s>
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.</s>It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.</s>The guy might not have been carrying anything.</s>Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.</s>
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.</s>Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.</s>
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?</s>I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.</s>

What are you going to tell the little ones?</s>I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.</s>Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?</s>They'll believe it because they want to believe it.</s>Shouldn't we tell Homer?</s>If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.</s>
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.</s>This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.</s>He will be alright.</s>
We did it.</s>Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.</s>
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.</s>...De profundis clamo ad te domine.</s>
You get the money?</s>No. What's this?</s>Plan B. Here ya go, honey...</s>
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.</s>Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.</s>Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.</s>
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.</s>About what?</s>Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.</s>Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.</s>Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.</s>
Uncle, you can't do this!</s>My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.</s>It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...</s>
Seventeen.</s>Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?</s>Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.</s>Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me.</s>
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.</s>Who was it?</s>
You mean that play?</s>Exactly.</s>He's setting that play to music?</s>Yes.</s>You must be mad.</s>

For infant genetic disorder.</s>
Kill that poor woman.</s>Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--</s>Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?</s>
Look again for fuck sake!</s>I know what the fuck he looks like!</s>
I believe you.</s>The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.</s>But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?</s>Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"</s>Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.</s>
No. Don't answer it!</s>Why?</s>
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.</s>That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.</s>Not if they're looking at something else.</s>Like what?</s>

You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".</s>Yes -- that's right. Production for use.</s>
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...</s>That's what you said?</s>Something witty and devastating like that.</s>
You gentlemen care for a drink?</s>No, none for me. Come on, let's play.</s>By all means.</s>

At your service, sir.</s>Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?</s>Good and evil; there is never one without the other.</s>
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.</s>Where?</s>Seven homes along the Black River so far...</s>

I don't think I'm gonna take it.</s>It's a gig.</s>I mean, I need the money.</s>You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.</s>It's definitely a step back for me.</s>Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.</s>There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.</s>What do you want? You're tall.</s>Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.</s>You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.</s>It's like "Hi, Mom.

She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage.

Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.</s>Not feeling too bad now are you?</s>No, sir, I feel really great.</s>Good.</s>Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?</s>Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.</s>
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.</s>Delgado?</s>Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.</s>
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.</s>Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.</s>

There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.</s>I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.</s>I like my horizons narrow.</s>Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.</s>
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.</s>'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?</s>Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.</s>And you never told nobody about it?</s>Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?</s>One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.</s>Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...</s>Here she goes again...</s>Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.</s>
Not that tie with that coat.</s>Why not?!</s>
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.</s>Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!</s>Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.</s>

What kind of a crash was it?</s>You seen my suitcase?</s>There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?</s>He didn't say much at all.  Honey --</s>In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?</s>Don't be so supportive, honey.</s>Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --</s>Four.  Four years --</s>Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.</s>Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?</s>How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?</s>
What about me?</s>Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?</s>No.</s>Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.</s>
So, you've got it all figured, do you?</s>Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.</s>I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.</s>
Why do you do that?</s>What?</s>Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...</s>I'm not-</s>You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?</s>
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.</s>So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--</s>
Good luck.</s>Thanks again for your help!</s>
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?</s>Surgically attached.</s>
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?</s>You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.</s>Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.</s>
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.</s>You are the younger of two...</s>

All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.</s>I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?</s>

Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!

This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.

Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'</s>Halloween.</s>'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'</s>
How much?  How much do I owe you?</s>My salary.  Two-fifty.</s>
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!</s>They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.</s>
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.</s>Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.</s>I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--</s>--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.</s>What a pity.</s>Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.</s>
They're gone.</s>Are you sure?</s>Yes.</s>
Can I ask you about Melanie?</s>Sure.</s>What's your relationship?</s>She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.</s>She believed you?</s>Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.</s>
Yeah, that's Stens.</s>Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.</s>
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?</s>No.</s>You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.</s>
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?</s>Absolutely--</s>--what about you?--</s>
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.</s>That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.</s>
Will they really teach me to shoot?</s>Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.</s>And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!</s>Oh sure.</s>How about hand-to-hand combat?</s>Yes.</s>To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.</s>Eh?</s>How about to slit his throat?</s>Well, I don't...</s>I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.</s>Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.</s>Sir, how about souvenirs?</s>Souvenirs?</s>Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.</s>Harold!</s>What's the chance of getting one of these?</s>
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.</s>And you get into any car you want and just drive off?</s>Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.</s>Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?</s>What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?</s>Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.</s>Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...</s>
Now, get out!!</s>Yes, ma'am!</s>Stop that ma'am crap!</s>Sorry!</s>
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.</s>King David.</s>Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.</s>
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?</s>Everything's fine, pop.</s>Last time you said that the renaissance happened.</s>Please, pop, just go back to your room.</s>Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?</s>Sure, pop. Whatever you want.</s>
That's Franny. She likes firemen.</s>Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.</s>
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...</s>Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..</s>
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.</s>What's he doing here?</s>Who, him? Just visiting.</s>
Where's the safe?</s>I don't know.</s>You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?</s>I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.</s>Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!</s>Don't yell at me!</s>
Same kind of crap--</s>--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.</s>
What's going on?</s>Victor, are you feeling alright?</s>
Back it down, Johnny!</s>I can go hotter!</s>
I was worried about you.</s>I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.</s>Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.</s>
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.</s>To my father.  Everything counts.</s>
Which way do I go?</s>What does it say.</s>Corridor A.</s>Take a left and your next right.</s>Where are we going?</s>
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.</s>Greetings.</s>
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...</s>But you wanted to fuck me first.</s>Oh, Maya. No.</s>Yeah.</s>
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.</s>If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.</s>
Someone else coming?</s>Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?</s>Uh, no --</s>You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.</s>You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.</s>
No gun.  How disarming.</s>I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?</s>Dear daisy, don't despair.</s>
Is your name Paul Benjamin?</s>What can I do for you?</s>I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.</s>How the hell did you get into the building?</s>What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?</s>The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?</s>I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.</s>Thomas? Who's Thomas?</s>Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.</s>I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.</s>Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.</s>You mean Rashid?</s>Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?</s>Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.</s>And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?</s>Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!</s>I just want to know where he is.</s>As far as I know, he went back to his parents.</s>His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?</s>That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.</s>I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.</s>He doesn't go to the Trinity School?</s>He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.</s>And his parents?</s>His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.</s>I shouldn't have let him go.</s>Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?</s>I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.</s>He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.</s>Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?</s>No thank you.</s>Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?</s>Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.</s>And you told your nephew about it?</s>I figured he had a right to know.</s>And?</s>And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."</s>Those are pretty hostile words.</s>
Is it a Kappa?</s>It's not a Theta --</s>
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.</s>Well... Well... Okay.</s>
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.</s>First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.</s>God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.</s>Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.</s>Are you for real?</s>Touchy, touchy!</s>
Is that funny?</s>It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.</s>Why?</s>Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.</s>It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.</s>I didn't have any.</s>You had no inner feeling?</s>None.</s>Then I must have been supplying it.</s>
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.</s>Good evening, Vincent.</s>What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?</s>I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.</s>
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?</s>Sure.</s>Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?</s>Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.</s>
Hi.  How's she doing?</s>I am glad to see you.</s>
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?</s>By accident?</s>
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.</s>Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.</s>I wasn't worried about us.</s>
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.</s>Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!</s>
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!</s>But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.</s>
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?</s>[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?</s>It's not my job to believe you.</s>
How'd it go?</s>He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.</s>
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?</s>Do I have to?</s>Yes, I'd like you to.</s>
Uh, oh...</s>What kind of luminous things, Bud?</s>
It's not enough.</s>What?</s>
Dad?</s>Yes?</s>I'm hungry.</s>Well you should have eaten your breakfast.</s>
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?</s>What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...</s>
You bitch.</s>Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*</s>Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.</s>Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.</s>
"Frenzy".</s>Yes I know.</s>
Are you playing tricks on me?</s>What?</s>It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.</s>
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.</s>You're welcome.  Did you find them?</s>Sort of.</s>
I better go.</s>I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.</s>
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.</s>Now, hold on.</s>Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...</s>
You still think I kill people, don't you?</s>No.</s>Liar.</s>
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?</s>I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.</s>Where are you going?</s>For a ride.</s>Wait, away?</s>Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.</s>To his hotel?</s>Shit, Jeff!</s>
Are you mad?</s>All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...</s>
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.</s>For what?</s>Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...</s>I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --</s>You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.</s>Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.</s>
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.</s>Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.</s>No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.</s>
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?</s>I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.</s>
What will you say?</s>To who?</s>What are you going to report back to Earth?</s>I don't know.</s>An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.</s>Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.</s>That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?</s>
So he's won.</s>No.</s>
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?</s>What... you mean "got into bed with" them?</s>No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?</s>You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?</s>No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?</s>HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?</s>What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...</s>It was different...</s>What was she like?</s>Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...</s>But you LOVED her all the same...</s>We never went to bed together.</s>Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?</s>You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?</s>I've never LOVED anybody!</s>I've never been to bed with anybody!</s>
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --</s>Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.</s>... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.</s>You can change.</s>Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.</s>Don't be so sure.</s>
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.</s>Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?</s>
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.</s>I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.</s>
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.</s>I shall remember to pay it... to myself.</s>
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.</s>The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...</s>Lecter said a lot of things.</s>He's here, Ardelia.</s>
Of course.</s>Do you want to have some breakfast?</s>
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.</s>I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.</s>You remember what I said about the Vitamins.</s>
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.</s>How about Ann? Is she going with you?</s>
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.</s>You mean about that gun?</s>That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.</s>
How come you were in my truck?</s>I was tired and didn't have any place to go.</s>
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?</s>Give it back? Are you nuts?</s>You pawned it.</s>Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.</s>
Which would you rather...?</s>Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?</s>Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--</s>--She's not dead---</s>It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?</s>Wow. I have to give this some thought.</s>No time.</s>Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.</s>
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.</s>Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?</s>I know a lot more than that</s>
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.</s>Why?</s>
Maybe so...</s>I wouldn't give up your day job.</s>
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.</s>I'm sorry -</s>I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?</s>It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...</s>And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...</s>The Pentagon?</s>It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.</s>Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.</s>I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.</s>What do you want with the Pentagon?</s>The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.</s>If you think -</s>You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?</s>You wouldn't dare.</s>So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.</s>
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?</s>Don't think that'd be wise.</s>I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.</s>I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.</s>
Jamie ...</s>Shoot him!</s>
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.</s>What?</s>Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.</s>
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.</s>Extend things?</s>Extend them.  C'mere for a second.</s>
We know what you're up to.</s>Probably goin' out to get Williams.</s>
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?</s>The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?</s>Home.</s>
I was a victim of circumstance.</s>They should have warned you about that one.</s>She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.</s>What'd you do?</s>Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.</s>
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?</s>Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.</s>
Maybe.  Maybe not.</s>What are you getting at?</s>Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.</s>Why would someone do that?</s>Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.</s>
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.</s>Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.</s>
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?</s>Have a look at this.</s>
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.</s>Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.</s>Yeah?</s>I'd like to... take you out or something.</s>Well, you're married.</s>Not yet. Not married.</s>Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.</s>Okay.</s>So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.</s>
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?</s>Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...</s>
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.</s>What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.</s>
Thanks for the shine.</s>Thanks for the tip.</s>
How long have I been here?</s>Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?</s>I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.</s>There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.</s>What do you mean?</s>What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!</s>Sera...</s>Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.</s>Me neither.</s>So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!</s>Sera you are crazy.</s>So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.</s>Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?</s>That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?</s>You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.</s>
Well done, Commander.</s>You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.</s>
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.</s>No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.</s>
Yeah.</s>This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.</s>So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.</s>That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.</s>
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...</s>I feel right now like there's one burning in me.</s>When's the audition?</s>A couple of weeks.</s>I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?</s>Would you?</s>Anything to help you out, Max.</s>This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.</s>Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-</s>All you got to do is name it.</s>Give Eve Harrington job in you office.</s>
Neil, how are you gonna do this?</s>Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.</s>From you?</s>From my father and Nolan.</s>Neil, you're not gonna...</s>Quiet.  I have to think.</s>
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.</s>Gardiner, yes, sir.</s>And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.</s>No problem, Chief.</s>
What do you mean?</s>Nothing. I didn't say anything.</s>
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!</s>Don't touch me.</s>I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.</s>
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?</s>No.</s>I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.</s>I'm not a rat.</s>
You know, Nick, we can't lose.</s>Why's that?</s>Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.</s>
I called Dan Koretzky because he --</s>Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?</s>Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.</s>WHAT?</s>Just local, of course.</s>And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"</s>I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.</s>You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?</s>What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?</s>That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?</s>Barry said its done.</s>Barry?  Barry knows about this?</s>Yeah.  His band is playing a set.</s>
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.</s>I decided it this morning.</s>Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --</s>I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!</s>But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --</s>Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!</s>
I can't do that?</s>Do what?</s>Let you leave without it.</s>Without what?</s>
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.</s>Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...</s>
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.</s>Where's that?</s>Carvel.</s>Carvel? Where's Carvel?</s>Outside Scranton.</s>I never heard of it.</s>It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.</s>Your father worked in a mannequin factory?</s>Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.</s>What kind of dancer?</s>Whatever kind they wanted her to be.</s>James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?</s>I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.</s>Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?</s>When we fall, we fall hard.</s>Amazing.</s>
It's your money. You talk.</s>I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.</s>Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.</s>Yeah.</s>You making a feature?</s>Um-hm. Live sound.</s>Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.</s>
Why not?</s>Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.</s>What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --</s>Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?</s>
You talk to 'em.</s>People are free to do what they wanna do.</s>
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...</s>I'm afraid she is, baby.</s>
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.</s>The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.</s>
They're not idiots.</s>Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?</s>Grounded for the rest of the year?</s>You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.</s>
Damn!  This will get him.</s>Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,</s>
You've got sand, for a maid.</s>Thank you, sir.</s>And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?</s>Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.</s>No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.</s>Can I trust you?</s>It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!</s>
May I please see the storage facility?</s>Why do you want to see it?</s>Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.</s>Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.</s>Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.</s>Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!</s>
How's your brother?</s>He's all right.</s>
It means a lot that you came by.</s>Yes, we appreciate that.</s>
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.</s>Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.</s>
Didn't you, baby?</s>Let go of me.</s>
Nothing...</s>See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?</s>
This is going to do nothing.</s>We have to go in the basement.</s>
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!</s>What's your problem Beavis?</s>
Come on, Night Shift.</s>INT. TUNNEL - DAY.</s>
It's all about who you know.</s>Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.</s>He's right.</s>
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.</s>Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.</s>
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.</s>What?</s>Shoot to kill, I said.</s>I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.</s>Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.</s>Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.</s>Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.</s>If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.</s>
That fucking figures...</s>Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.</s>
I know he really likes you.</s>How do you know that?  Did he say something?</s>No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.</s>
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.</s>Now that is an interesting proposition.</s>
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.</s>He's right. Nice guitar break.</s>
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!</s>You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...</s>
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.</s>I won't let the fat kid down.</s>
We don't.</s>Well maybe there's a way out of here.</s>Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.</s>
Hey, try swimming. It works.</s>What the fuck are you talking about.</s>Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.</s>
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.</s>You're probably the only one who could carry it off.</s>
What do we do now, Nick?</s>We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.</s>
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.</s>You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.</s>He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!</s>
It's probably from being around all this food every day.</s>Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.</s>
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?</s>We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?</s>
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.</s>And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?</s>I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.</s>
That guy rules!</s>Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...</s>So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!</s>No.</s>
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.</s>You really hit a guy with a bottle?</s>
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.</s>Personal matters.</s>Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -</s>Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.</s>
There are no more rooms.</s>Give me the phone.</s>
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--</s>Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?</s>I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!</s>That's right!</s>
All I have to do is squeeze.</s>All I have to do is scream.</s>
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?</s>I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.</s>
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.</s>Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.</s>We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?</s>
So, you just got out?</s>Jesus, Caesar!</s>What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?</s>
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?</s>We were just having a little discussion about morality.</s>
Water...water...</s>Water...water -- oh, you already said that.</s>My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.</s><u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?

Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.</s>It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.</s>He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.</s>And English, and trig</s>
Tom, where are you going --</s>Home, I'm done.</s>What about the confession?</s>
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.</s>Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.</s>
Is this Nigel's doing?</s>It's a warning, that's for sure.</s>Maybe it was just an accident.</s>There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.</s>
Hurry up with those papers.</s>Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?</s>
I asked you what you studied.</s>Tell him!</s>
Why am I doing this?</s>It's an experiment.</s>
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?</s>If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?</s>Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...</s>Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.</s>Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?</s>
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.</s>You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.</s>
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.</s>I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?</s>
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....</s>That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?</s>I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to --</s>
That makes it all the more difficult ——</s>Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?</s>We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.</s>Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?</s>I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.</s>Of course.</s>
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</s>We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.</s>
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.</s>It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.</s>
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.</s>Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.</s>
Can I ride one sometime...?</s>It's too dangerous....</s>
How about you?</s>No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.</s>You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.</s>Why?</s>Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?</s>Sure, I'll go.</s>I'll go with you.</s>Swell!</s>
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.</s>So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?</s>If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.</s>
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.</s>Hello?</s>Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.</s>
Joseph C. Gillis?</s>That's right.</s>

Dr. Niko Topopolosis?</s>It's Tatopoulos.</s>Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?</s>Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?</s>Follow me.</s>
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...</s>Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.</s>Granville?</s>My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...</s>
She said lots of thing.s</s>Willow!</s>
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.</s>Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?</s>If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.</s>Don't you care about what's happened?</s>Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?</s>There must be an answer somewhere.</s>True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.</s>Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?</s>
You thought I was Mom?</s>Yeah!</s>It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.</s>And you dropped it?</s>Yeah!  Shh!</s>That's funny!</s>I better clean this up before she sees it.</s>
Good God... they're shooting Midge!</s>Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.</s>
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!</s>He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.</s>
Unidentified Flying Objects.</s>Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'</s>
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?</s>Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.</s>
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?</s>While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.</s>
Just stay away from me, okay?</s>Did you ever dream that you were someone else?</s>
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.</s>So who killed him?</s>The Disco Boys.</s>
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?</s>No, it wasn't, It was intentional.</s>Why would we want to hurt you?</s>Not you. Them.</s>Who?</s>I don't know Who.</s>
Your mother wants to hear from you --</s>GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.</s>
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --</s>If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.</s>
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?</s>Because I'm alienated.</s>
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.</s>Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.</s>
I am so sorry about your men.</s>Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.</s>And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?</s>Don't worry, he's with Carter.</s>
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?</s>Oh, god...</s>
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.</s>I'm just saying.</s>Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?</s>
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!</s>Yes... But -- how...?</s>Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!</s>

They're migrants.</s>Migrants?</s>Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.</s>

Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.</s>Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.</s>
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.</s>There was a message, wasn't there?</s>It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.</s>Marion!

But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?</s>Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.</s>I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.</s>Clearly, yes comrade.</s>Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'</s>Very good, Your Excellency.</s>

There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.

Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.</s>Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?</s>I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?</s>Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?</s>I have met her.  What is your business with me?</s>I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.</s>That is correct.</s>This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.</s>A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.</s>I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.</s>And he sent you to me?</s>He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.</s>Does your mother know you have come?</s>No, sir.</s>Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.</s>My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.</s>You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?</s>
Hi!  Hi!</s>I know...I know.</s>Glad you could put in an appearance.</s>I got two minutes.</s>Very good.</s>
Did you try to kill...</s>What?</s>Nothing. How's your hand?</s>About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?</s>Like you don't know...</s>I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?</s>I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...</s>I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...</s>Hey, I thought...</s>
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.</s>That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.</s>
In English, please.</s>I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.</s>
What's this about?</s>Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.</s>You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --</s>-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?</s>
Did, uh... Did you kill him?</s>I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.</s>
So who'd you hire?</s>Ruth Rabino.</s>
Help!</s>Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.</s>
How so?</s>Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.</s>
What's your name?</s>Pris.</s>Mine's J.F. Sebastian.</s>Hi.</s>
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.</s>What did you do to your hair?</s>My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.</s>It's nice.</s>

Nine bodies.</s>Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?</s>

I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.</s>

You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.</s>Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.

You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.</s>What... What are you talking about?</s>Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.</s>Excuse me?</s>I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?</s>

Huey man I got to talk with you...</s>So talk...</s>Alone...</s>Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...</s>
Who was that?</s>That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?</s>Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.</s>But why would a man need more than one woman?</s>I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.</s>
Remember, there's safety in numbers.</s>Yeah, okay... whatever.</s>Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.</s>

Wants me to sail it for him.</s>You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.</s>I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--</s>It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.</s>Wait a second--</s>Ah, I can smell it on you.</s>
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.</s>You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.

Stuff nobody'd ever want.</s>Can we see?</s>You gonna buy?</s>I don't know.  Maybe.</s>Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.</s>
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.

Where are you going?</s>To the hotel. To register.</s>Without your pants.</s>Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.</s>
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.</s>Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.</s>It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.</s>Yes.</s>She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.</s>Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.</s>Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.</s>
How's it going upstairs?</s>Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.</s>
Now what?</s>Turn off the engine.</s>
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!</s>FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!</s>
It's not going to help us!</s>We're going to die here! We're going to die!</s>
Look, food!</s>That's not food.  Can't be food.</s>Looks like food.</s>
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.</s>Inventin' jokes ain't easy.</s>
It looks a bit fishy to me.</s>Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?</s>
Yes, sir...</s>You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!</s>
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.</s>Antarctica??</s>Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.</s>Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.</s>You and me.</s>
Hello, young fellow.</s>Hello, Mr. deMille.</s>
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.</s>Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.</s>
No.</s>"No"?  "No" to which part??</s>No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.</s>
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!</s>Precisely!</s>
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?</s>Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.</s>Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.</s>They were out of line --</s>They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.</s>That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --</s>Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.</s>I'll work it off.</s>Not driving Jess, you won't.</s>What?</s>You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.</s>So, that's it. I'm out?</s>I didn't say that.</s>Then what are you saying?</s>Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.</s>I don't understand.</s>It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.</s>I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --</s>Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?</s>No.</s>Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.</s>I know.</s>Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?</s>Yeah. Sorry.</s>I got a way we make everybody happy.</s>Yeah.</s>We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.</s>Ruiz knows about this?</s>Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.</s>What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.</s>Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?</s>You told him you liked him.</s>That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.</s>He'll work it off.</s>I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.</s>He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.</s>You vouch for him?</s>

Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.</s>Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.</s>

And now we got a beautiful thing.</s>It's a beautiful thing.</s>A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.</s>
How many people do you all feed?</s>Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.</s>Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.</s>Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.</s>Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.</s>
What was that?</s>They all get the wrong idea.</s>
Hi.</s>I thought you wasn't comin'.</s>
What do you mean, West's?</s>I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?</s>

Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?</s>Soldado.</s>Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?</s>Shu's the only one I know of...</s>And why was an exception made?</s>Chinatown.

We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.</s>We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.</s>How do you send out an APB on a dead man?</s>Huh?, sir.</s>I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.</s>
Great crowd.</s>No such thing, baby.</s>

See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.</s>This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?</s>Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?</s>

Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.</s>Well, I don't want to put you out.</s>
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?</s>Who are you?</s>I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.</s>Why should I?</s>For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.</s>I don't know what you mean.</s>Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.</s>I only have a hundred dollars or so.</s>That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.</s>

Emergencies only.</s>What the hell would you call this?</s>I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.</s>

S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.</s>Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...</s>
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.</s>What's the terrain down there?</s>Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.</s>Is it solid?</s>It's... basalt.  Rock.</s>Then take her down.</s>Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.</s>

You've got your money--</s>I don't want your money!</s>
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...</s>You've got a fruit loop in your hair.</s>You say that like I don't know that.</s>I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --</s>And when did that pass?</s>Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.</s>
When you figure on branding?</s>Weekend after next...</s>
How're the cameras doing?</s>Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.</s>
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.</s>Well, look at the plus side.</s>There's a plus side?</s>Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.</s>It was a tough call.</s>I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.</s>I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.</s>Why?</s>To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.</s>
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.</s>I could get the death penalty.</s>You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.

Are you okay?</s>I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.</s>It's going to be okay.</s>
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.</s>Why are you lecturing me?</s>This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.</s>I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.</s>I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.</s>And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.</s>
What's this?</s>Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.</s>
Like the claw.</s>Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.</s>Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.</s>Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?</s>
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?</s>1530 Rivington Street.</s>-- What?</s>Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.</s>You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.</s>

It was illegal, what he did.</s>You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...</s>
Who painted that?</s>Marc Chagall. A Russian.</s>Kinda gaudy.</s>He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.</s>
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.</s>Any particular kind?</s>Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.</s>
How did you know?</s>It hit me like a ton of bricks.</s>How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.</s>The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?</s>
Hello, bomb, are you with me?</s>Of course.</s>Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?</s>I am always receptive to suggestions.</s>Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?</s>
Was someone in an accident?</s>Do I hear a woman's voice?</s>
Where... do those men come from, George?</s>Africa, of course.</s>Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?</s>Slavers capture them and bring them here.</s>Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.</s>Sally, our slave system is a British law...</s>
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?</s>I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...</s>Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.</s>
I already called for an ambulance.</s>You've got a <u>phone</u>?</s>Doesn't everybody?</s>
What's the pumpkin for?</s>I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.</s>I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.</s>Thanks.</s>For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.</s>
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?</s>The attic.</s>
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?</s>Yes.</s>
Okay, start pedaling.</s>Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.</s>Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.</s>Daddy, I'm scared.</s>C'mon, Chief, show some guts.</s>
I think I better take you home.</s>What about those other guys you live with?</s>No. I mean back to your home.</s>
What's the matter?</s>I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?</s>
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.</s>Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.</s>What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.</s>But what can I say to her, sir?</s>Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.</s>
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.</s>Anyone at home?</s>I live there. Alone.</s>Someone is sitting in that window.</s>My mother.</s>
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".</s>"Thunder lizard!"</s>
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.

I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!</s>Who?</s>That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.</s>
Do you believe him?</s>No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.</s>
Well... where is he?</s>There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.</s>
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?</s>I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..</s>Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?</s>I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?</s>Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.</s>
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?</s>The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?</s>She's my daughter, Tom.</s>So?</s>So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.</s>Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?</s>
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --</s>Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.</s>

Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.</s>I know Albert. We're friends.</s>I heard you was more than friends.

That's just a total lie.</s>
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.</s>Hold your breath and we'll pull.</s>

Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!</s>Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --</s>Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?</s>Harry, you don't have to believe!

Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.</s>That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.</s>

So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?</s>Catherine told me what was in it.</s>If she's telling  you the truth.</s>Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.</s>How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?</s>He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.</s>

Wasn't that sweet of me?</s>More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.

They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?</s>You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.</s>Nuns?</s>

Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.</s>The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.</s>I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.</s>Surely not.</s>I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...</s>
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.</s>They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?</s>

I think she's starting to suspect something?</s>Who?</s>
He's writing his name in water.</s>What's that?</s>Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.</s>That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.</s>He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.</s>

If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.</s>How grave?</s>Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.</s>
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.</s>You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?</s>When did you first do business with this Bertrand?</s>Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.</s>Street cats?</s>Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...</s>
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.</s>She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.</s>
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --</s>I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.</s>
You guys used to work together?</s>Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.</s>

This was very sweet of you.</s>Well. Hope you enjoy it.</s>
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.</s>Then I'm here till I die?</s>Till they kill you. Yeah.</s>Then why bother curing me?</s>The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.</s>So it's to be torture.</s>

I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?</s>We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.</s>And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!</s>I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.</s>He had his palm print on the weapon.</s>It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?</s>
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.</s>He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...</s>The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.</s>He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...</s>He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.</s>
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.</s>Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.</s>Actually, you may take it all now.</s>Oh...

Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.</s>Sure.</s>
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...</s>You made this, and the drawings?</s>Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.</s>Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?</s>
Stuff, sir?</s>That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.</s>Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.</s>Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.</s>Yes, sir.</s>
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?</s>No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.</s>Oh.</s>

...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.</s>That's right.</s>And what did your team do...</s>Well, we...</s>...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.

Hello there, children!!</s>Hey, Chef.</s>How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?</s>
You going to answer it?</s>Uh-uh.</s>
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.</s>Bravo.</s>Aw, you're tough.</s>I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.</s>Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.</s>

Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --</s>I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.</s>I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.</s>
Feeling better?</s>Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?</s>Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.</s>We can't play today?</s>Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.

I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.</s>Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.</s>I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.

But you need to know what you're dealing with.</s>I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.</s>Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes.</s>
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile.

Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.</s>Baron!</s>
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.</s>Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?</s>
Must've been some experience for you, huh?</s>Yes.</s>I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?</s>I'm going back tomorrow.</s>

There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.</s>That's too bad.

Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.</s>I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!</s>
Mom?</s>Here, honey!</s>
How'd you get in here?</s>I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.</s>So what brings you to L.A., Bones?</s>Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.</s>

That doesn't seem much for a murder.</s>How do you put a price on murder?</s>I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?</s>Make it twenty.</s>Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.

When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?</s>I... yes.</s>Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.

You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine.</s>Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.</s>My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.</s>She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.</s>You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?</s>I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back.</s>It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.</s>Good night, sir.</s>Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.</s>
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.</s>Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.</s>He probably thinks he's saving you from something.

Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely.

Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.</s>Is that right?</s>Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.</s>I can't say I know Patrick all that well.</s>Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?</s>Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'</s>
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.</s>We were going to get married. Are going to get married!</s>Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.</s>This is the old highway.</s>I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.</s>Watch your tenses.</s>Huh?</s>She always tries to be proper.</s>

I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?</s>Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.</s>People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle.

It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.</s>

Next time we'll bring more blankets.</s>That would be nice.</s>Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.</s>That would be nice, too.</s>

Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.

I laughed so much I like to died.</s>Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.</s>I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --</s>Now, Fran --</s>And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --</s>Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.</s>

And little Johnny?'</s>My son's name is Johnny?</s>Yup.</s>Well, get a message through to him too.</s>Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.</s>What do you think?</s>Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.</s>You think I should do Henry James instead?</s>I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.</s>Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'</s>And I think the book is the poorer for it.</s>
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!</s>It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.</s>

I'm,flexible.</s>Right.</s>
Primitive?</s>I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.</s>

If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose.

You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?</s>It is.</s>Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.</s>He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.</s>But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?</s>It was dead.  We had it tested.

Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.</s>Attacked how?</s>She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.</s>You didn't believe her?</s>No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.</s>Why not?</s>They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.</s>People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?</s>They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk.

It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.</s>Does Alyssa know?</s>Nothing.</s>You got any weed?</s>You got the money?</s>
Hit the brakes!</s>They're jammed!</s>
I buy companies.</s>No shit.  They expensive?</s>
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.</s>And what was that?</s>Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.</s>Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?</s>I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.</s>And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?</s>What telegram?</s>'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'</s>I have no idea what you're talking about.</s>The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.</s>I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.</s>Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.</s>I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.</s>
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.</s>Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?</s>
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.</s>What?</s>A Tab.</s>
Would you like a drink now?</s>No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?</s>
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?</s>Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.</s>
What is it?</s>The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.</s>A hotel?</s>It's not used for anything.</s>
Thank you very much for everything.</s>And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.</s>Yes, sir.</s>
Sure.</s>Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.</s>
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?</s>Yeah, okay.  Okay.</s>
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.</s>Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--</s>How 'bout a drink at the bar?</s>
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.</s>I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.</s>Who are his ghosts?</s>Ask him.</s>What if I told you he did this to me?</s>What?  How could he have?  When?</s>I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.</s>I don't know what that means.</s>Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.</s>Please don't creep around this house.</s>
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --</s>The fuck are you talking about --</s>You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --</s>Bullshit --</s>Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --</s>Shut up!</s>
Objection.  You're leading the witness.</s>Sure.</s>
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...</s>You had a heart attack?</s>Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.</s>That’s why I work for Big Ed?</s>
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?</s>Okay.</s>
And what's that?</s>How about you give us what you have and leave.</s>What?</s>Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?</s>
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.</s>Aha. Who do you think will win the war?</s>I haven't the slightest idea.</s>
Come on, Ray. Come forward.</s>No way, Cooch.</s>
Bullshit.</s>Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!</s>What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.</s>Someone has to do something.</s>Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.</s>
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?</s>Why is everything about you, Jeff?</s>
Feeling better?</s>Much.</s>Is the dizziness gone?</s>I think so.</s>

You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.</s>Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.</s>Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.</s>
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!</s>Oh -- Jabez.</s>
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.</s>Fuck you.</s>Anytime.  Anywhere.</s>
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...</s>I hear you.</s>Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.</s>
Where you going?</s>C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.</s>
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.</s>Great.</s>I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.</s>I ain't never going back to that school, sir.</s>You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.</s>I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.</s>
I've got a hot one.</s>You go, boy.</s>If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.</s>
What is it?</s>I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.</s>
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.</s>I wanta get some things.</s>I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--</s>I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.</s>Whatcha wanta order?</s>I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...</s>
What are they?</s>They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.</s>No screamin' shit.</s>Oh no, it's the Doctor.</s>Who?</s>The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.</s>
I'll sleep around a little.</s>Thanks, Cooch.</s>And get rid of the dog.</s>
How many of them are there?</s>Too many.</s>
Feeling a little better, I see.</s>Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.</s>
What you going to do?</s>I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.</s>
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.</s>You think I'm lying?</s>I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.</s>
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.</s>That's why she kills children.</s>I know, I know--</s>
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.</s>Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.</s>Right.</s>
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?</s>Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.</s>
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?</s>Care to make a small wager?</s>I've been here twice as long as you have --</s>Shall we say -- a dollar?</s>It's a bet.</s>
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?</s>Maybe milking.</s>Milking?</s>Cows. You know, cows?</s>I've seen pictures.</s>Good, you start tomorrow.</s>
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.</s>Thanks.</s>No problem.</s>
Daddy?</s>I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.</s>
He's heeeeeerrre...</s>Oh my God.  Where?</s>He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.</s>Is he looking at us?</s>Nope.</s>
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.</s>Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...</s>
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.</s>No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.</s>
What are you bitching about now?</s>What are you doing here?</s>I forgot some of my stuff.</s>Your stuff?  Let me see that.</s>
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.</s>Jon, what is it?</s>The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.</s>Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?</s>I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.</s>Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.</s>Eve ...</s>
Jesus!</s>Oh my God! Adrienne?</s>
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.</s>How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?</s>
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.</s>No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?</s>
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.</s>How much?</s>About twenty-four thousand.</s>It was more than that last week.</s>Yeah.</s>Here's twenty-five thousand.</s>
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?</s>I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?</s>It is.</s>What exactly is he charged with?</s>Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.</s>He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.</s>
You gonna be alright?</s>Sure. I'm sorry.</s>No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.</s>Get some more beer.</s>I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.</s>Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.</s>
Not exactly.  Wallis?</s>More like two-two point two million.</s>In any case we don't want your cash.</s>
Let's talk Hubley.</s>His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.</s>With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.</s>Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.</s>Nice signal, dickwad!</s>
Carnes? Wait.</s>Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.</s>What are you talking about? Bateman is what?</s>Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?</s>
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?</s>Sure. Family. I know how that goes.</s>He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.</s>Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.</s>You gave him the money?</s>I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.</s>Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?</s>Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.</s>A zillion, huh? That's a lot.</s>
Where to?</s>To see a man about a thing.</s>I can do that.</s>
I think it's sad...</s>Traumas of a ten-year old.</s>

What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.</s>I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.</s>
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever</s>To come?</s>Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.</s>
Now don't fuss, Paul.</s>Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?</s>
You can help us.</s>What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.</s>

I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.</s>Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.</s>

Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?</s>Who?</s>
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?</s>Eight dollars.</s>That's not bad.</s>
Anything else I can get you?</s>Some cigars.  Case of beer.</s>There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.</s>I won't light the cigars - how about that?</s>I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.</s>What if I like the pain?</s>
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.</s>The nanobot is gone.</s>
They won't be riding in the wagon.</s>Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.</s>You can't leave us here.</s>Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.</s>
There.</s>Oh --</s>
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...</s>Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.</s>Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.</s>Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?</s>
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.</s>Rod, get on the camel.</s>
My love... because I love you.</s>I love you too... too late... too late...</s>No... we're together...</s>Too late... there's something I must do...</s>
Where'd she go?</s>She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.</s>
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.</s>We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.</s>But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.</s>Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?</s>
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?</s>At Annie's house. She's all right.</s>
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.</s>Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.</s>Pablo said no?</s>Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.</s>

Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..</s>You're not strong.

Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.</s>I love my heddles.  Show me again.</s>
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.</s>Announcing what?</s>There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...</s>So what?  This victim...</s>... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.</s>Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.</s>One is gluttony.</s>
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.</s>You're not very ambitious, are you?</s>Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.</s>You work too fast for me, young man.</s>Aw--give a feller a break.

Recluse. Kinder word.</s>You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...</s>
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened?

That's not following!</s>Well, what is your definition of following?</s>Following is different. I was spying.</s>Do you realize how paranoid you are?</s>Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.</s>That is the worst kind of paranoia.</s>Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh.

Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.</s>Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.</s>Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will.

Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?</s>For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.</s>Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.</s>No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women.

It was awful.</s>

We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.

Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?</s>Yes, yes.</s>

He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."</s>Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.

Didn't you say you told her not to come?</s>Yeah.</s>Then why are you looking for her?</s>It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.</s>

Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.</s>What do you mean, walked?</s>Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago.

I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...</s>...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!</s>No, Elden, I need to...</s>You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...</s>She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.</s>It wasn't a woman.</s>Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...</s>I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!</s>
This is its current position.</s>Can you project its course?</s>
How's the baby?</s>Sleeping inside me.</s>Does it feel like a boy?</s>Yes, Michael, it does.</s>I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.</s>It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.</s>
Have you heard?</s>No, I haven't heard.</s>There was a second.</s>
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.</s>This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.</s>

I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.</s>
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.</s>We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.</s>

Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.</s>Old fool!</s>
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.</s>I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?</s>It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.</s>
Superman? Has something happened to him?</s>Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.</s>You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.</s>
The partners want to know how it's going?</s>How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!</s>

OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!</s>YOU BASTARD!!</s>
Pull my laces tighter.</s>I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to.

Okay - got light duty, three days.</s>Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.</s>What you got there - beers?</s>Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.</s>
What's he doing now?</s>He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!</s>
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!</s>Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.</s>
Don't screw around man, pull it!</s>You do it... you first!</s>One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!</s>You first!</s>Okay!</s>

Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...</s>You threatening my family, now, too?</s>Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...</s>"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...</s>That's why we hire scientists...</s>Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.</s>I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.</s>
Aye-gor!</s>Fro-derick!</s>What are you doing here?</s>I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.</s>
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.</s>They asked me to help.</s>I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?</s>
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...</s>That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.</s>I am prepared to write anything you tell me.</s>
Rough day?</s>Rough life, Jack.</s>
Francie, you know I can't do that.</s>Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.</s>They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.</s>
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.</s>She told me not to talk to you.</s>Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.</s>She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...</s>Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.</s>

No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.</s>Man?</s>Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.</s>It's a piece.</s>Your sure as hell right about that.</s>I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.</s>
Jack. Do you need a ride?</s>No. Thanks.</s>My car's in the garage.</s>Maybe another time.</s>I'll take you up on that.</s>Goodnight.</s>
No, we don't mind.</s>Good.</s>Sound good to you, Danny?</s>

Peter...</s>No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.</s>That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.</s>I can't think any more, unless it's about you.

Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.</s>
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.</s>What do you want from me?</s>At the moment, very little.  Your company at my table...</s>

We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.</s>You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.</s>
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --</s>Yes, but it's not all I feel.</s>Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --</s>Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.</s>But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?</s>
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.</s><i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i></s>
The timing was off -- I need this light.</s><u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...</s>Hold lunch!</s>But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!</s>It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.</s>
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...</s>'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.</s>
Udesky.</s>He's this way.</s>
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.</s>He's alive?</s>
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?</s>No sir.</s>
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.</s>Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?</s>
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?</s>Yes.</s>Where are you now?</s>I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.</s>Are you hurting her?</s>No, protecting her.</s>
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?</s>Because I found out about her...</s>About who?</s>Anne Lively...</s>
You own a hotel, sir?</s>The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?</s>
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...</s>Claire, please...</s>
You're late.</s><u>I'm</u> dressed.</s>
What does that mean ?</s>Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.</s>
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?</s>It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.</s>You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.</s>The why'd the police let him go?</s>Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.</s>
So you don't mind?</s>I've got to finish this chapter anyway.</s>
So what should we do?</s>Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.</s>What is this?</s>I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.</s>
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?</s>Please, go ahead.</s>Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?</s>For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.</s>
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.</s>We'll be there.</s>Goodnight.</s>
I'm sorry, Claudia.</s>What is it?  Did you forget something?</s>No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.</s>You wanna go on a date with me?</s>Please, yes.</s>Well...is that illegal?</s>No.</s>Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?</s>I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.</s>Really?</s>Yeah.</s>I thought you were flirting with me a little.</s>
Shelly?</s>Hey! Oh look.</s>He's so tiny.</s>I know, look at his little hands.</s>
Bring him out of what?</s>My dream.</s>How you plan to do that?</s>Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.</s>Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!</s>If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.</s>I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.</s>Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.</s>What!?</s>You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?</s>You crazy? Hit him with what?</s>You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...</s>Meanwhile...?</s>Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.</s>
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...</s>It can be arranged...</s>
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --</s>You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.</s>
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...</s>First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...</s>You know what I mean.</s>Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?</s>Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.</s>All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.</s>
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?</s>An apology.</s>
I said where?  Where'd you go?!</s>Was dark... find a light...</s>You lying bastard...</s>
What do you think of him?</s>Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.</s>You go to school together?</s>No, we never did that</s>Oh --</s>We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?</s>Well, I really think he's got a chance.</s>You do?</s>Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.</s>He ain't really new.</s>He is to a lot of people.</s>He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.</s>You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.</s>Where are you from?</s>Southern California.</s>You always live there?</s>Spent time in Arizona. Why?</s>Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?</s>I know a couple.</s>No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?</s>Ah... Peter Finch.</s>Who?</s>Peter Finch -- he's English.</s>I never heard of him. Name somebody else.</s>Ryan O'Neal.</s>You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?</s>Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.</s>I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?</s>Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.</s>I'll be dammed.</s>
Yes. Go ahead.</s>What the bloody hell plan is this?</s>
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?</s>Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?</s>No -- we're going to attack the termites!</s>Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!</s>
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.</s>Nadia, I can't --</s>Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.</s>
I have the White House on the Line.</s>...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.</s>
This one's going to be even more fun.</s>Go ahead. Make my evening.</s>
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?</s>I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.</s>
Don't worry, Mom. I know.</s>Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.</s>
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.</s>You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.</s>
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.</s>Heh heh. Thank God.</s>
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?</s>They say you never forget.</s>Forget what?</s>Forget how to ride a bike.</s>
You can go first.</s>No -- after you.</s>
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.</s>Where the fuck do you think you're going?</s>
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.</s>Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.</s>

I mean they want to get caught.</s>Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.</s>
What?</s>We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.</s>And?</s>No primer.</s>How can that be?</s>I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.</s>
What are you staring at?</s>Uh...</s>
Get off my stage!  You're fired!</s>I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!</s>

That was such a great evening.</s>I'm delighted.</s>
Well...</s>Oh come on, Pitts...</s>
Watery headed bunch.</s>I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.</s>
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...</s>Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.</s>I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...</s>
My brother's a priest, man.</s>No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.</s>
Pops!</s>The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.</s>You still got the Olds?</s>You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.</s>That's okay. You're driving.</s>
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.</s>Well, for heaven's sake!</s>
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.</s>Well—</s>Well, what?</s>Well, aren't you going to invite me?</s>You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.</s>Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.</s>Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.</s>No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.</s>Why are you so anxious?</s>Don't you know?</s>No.</s>I want to be near you!</s>
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.</s>We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.</s>
I want to learn to read it.</s>Why?</s>Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?</s>Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.</s>I'm good at languages.</s>
What?</s>You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?</s>You bastard!</s>We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.</s>You pig!</s>
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.</s>I'm going.</s>

What's up with this shit.</s>I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.</s>
Everyone aboard young Bill?</s>Yes, Sir.</s>Good.  Let's go sailing.</s>
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --</s>I don't believe it.</s>Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.</s>We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.</s>That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.</s>
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!</s>All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!</s>This is the Morning Post you're talking to!</s>The power of the press, huh!</s>
My car.</s>Your car?</s>
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...</s>I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.</s>
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.</s>What? That made her lose the baby?</s>Something. Someone.</s>
What do you say to that?</s>I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.</s>
You're a window rattler, son.</s>Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?</s>
The deal's too good, Frankie</s>What are ya thinkin', Charlie?</s>
You're crazy.</s>How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?</s>Not bad enough to kill him.</s>Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...</s>
What happened?</s>Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?</s>We followed Jade Fox.</s>
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.</s>No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,</s>
I've talked to your father.</s>That's what I mean.</s>
I do need to see Starling.</s>Starling?</s>Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?</s>Yes he is.</s>Well, I need to speak to him.</s>
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?</s>Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.</s>I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.</s>
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.</s>That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!</s>Well, I'm as human as the next man.</s>I was the next man.</s>Ships that pass in the night...</s>
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.</s>Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.</s>My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?</s>We like to think so, yeah.</s>And you don't deal drugs?</s>
What if I say no.</s>Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.</s>
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?</s>She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.</s>
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...</s>Don't give me this, we were partners.</s>Billy, go ahead, break it...</s>No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.</s>When?</s>I can't get it until Monday. Honest.</s>You chickenshit punk...</s>Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...</s>
I thought you weren't dying.</s>I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.</s>
Well?</s>Well what?</s>This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?</s>If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.</s>Say the Word!</s>
Nervous?</s>With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?</s>
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?</s>I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.</s>
I thought we should celebrate.</s>I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.</s>Ronald?</s>Not that it's any of your business but yes.</s>
What's this?</s>Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?</s>
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.</s>But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?</s>I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.</s>
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!</s>Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!</s>Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .</s>Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?</s>
There's just one more thing.</s>What's that?</s>Will you marry me?</s>
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?</s>Huh?</s>You still have that watch Auggie gave you?</s>Tick-tock, tick-tock.</s>So what's the time?</s>Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.</s>
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!</s>Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.</s>
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.</s>How did you hear this?</s>He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.</s>
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?</s>You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.</s>What? You've gotta be kidding!</s>Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.</s>I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.</s>That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.</s>
Think she really killed those agents?</s>She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.</s>Amnesia?</s>Possibly. Split personality ...</s>Insane ... ?</s>Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.</s>Why?</s>She may try to kill you.</s>
They changed Franklin's portrait.</s>You think it's a conspiracy?</s>Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.</s>
I've been dreaming about you.</s>Day or night?</s>
Where have you been?</s>Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?</s>You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.</s>Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.</s>What is that... wailing?</s>The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.</s>
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...</s>The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.</s>Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.</s>
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.</s>When did they find her?</s>

Did you get the letter?</s>What letter?</s>What letter?</s>
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.</s>Why?</s>Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.</s>What about E.M.S. recombination?</s>We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.</s>
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.</s>Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.</s>Shut up.</s>

What is it?</s>The tunnel.</s>
Won't come out, eh?</s>No, he's very upset about something.</s>Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.</s>
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.</s>My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.</s>
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?</s>You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.</s>

Fuck you, Dave...</s>"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"</s>
It's okay, everybody does that.</s>I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?</s>No.</s>I just can't have any social life right now.</s>Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.</s>Be friends?</s>Yeah.  With potential.</s>Friends with potential.</s>
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.</s>The standard ten.</s>Ten percent. Of how much?</s>Two million.</s>

Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?</s>He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.</s>Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --</s>
I'll be back ...</s>Where are you going?</s>Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...</s>You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.</s>No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.</s>But --</s>Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.</s>If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --</s>
If you can't look anymore, I understand...</s>As long as they're dead...</s>These are all dead, Will.</s>
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.</s>The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?</s>
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.</s>I love you so much, Leon.</s>I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.</s>

Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.</s>Yeah.</s>
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.</s>How high up does this...arms dealing go?</s>Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.</s>But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.</s>
I was talking with someone!</s>Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.</s>
That was a long time ago.</s>And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.</s>

Look at you.</s>What?</s>Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.

But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.</s>They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.</s>That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...</s>
So what year are you going into?</s>Junior.</s>Got a boyfriend back home?</s>No.</s>Why not?</s>I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.</s>You a lesbo?</s>No.</s>

S. government.</s>May I have a sandwich, please?</s>

This is crazy --</s>Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?</s>You don't know anything about Joe --</s>What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.</s>

This is terrific work, if you like rejection.</s>I never scared anyone before.</s>It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?</s>Facts or theory?</s>Anything you've got.</s>We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.</s>And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down.

What about him?</s>I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.</s>Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.</s>That was Peterson upstairs.</s>It was you who did the asking.</s>He doesn't think you run mind games on him.</s>I wouldn't presume to try.</s>You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?</s>He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.</s>Why aren't you ever alone with him?</s>Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?</s>His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?</s>I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...</s>That's when it happened?</s>No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.</s>What's the bottom line?</s>If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?</s>Could he handle a direct contact?</s>I don't recommend it.</s>
You're kidding.</s>But it's true!  You can call him yourself.</s>
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.</s>Thank you, Exposition.</s>Oh, and Austin...</s>Yes?</s>Be careful.</s>Thanks.</s>
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.</s>'Bye.</s>
