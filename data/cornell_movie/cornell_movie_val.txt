Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.</s>What about Ray?</s>
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?</s>Don't bother.</s>

What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?</s>I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.</s>
You said nobody came in here!</s>Obviously I was wrong!</s>
What are you doing in there?</s>Nothing. Be right out.</s>

There a maid in this hotel?</s>I don't know, why?</s>If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?</s>They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.</s>What kind of cop were you before this?</s>I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?</s>Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.</s>
Dreams?</s>I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.</s>You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.</s>
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?</s>He's crazy.</s>No, he's not. You are.</s>You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.</s>It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.</s>Fuck you, kid.</s>

And keep your meat hooks off my radio.</s>
We've lost contact.</s>Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.</s>There's no plug to pull.</s>What?</s>There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.</s>
So would I.</s>Bring him in.</s>I can't. He disappeared...</s>
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.</s>What the hell's going on?</s>We're going to get some food.</s>Are you out of your mind?</s>
Who?</s>The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...</s>
What?</s>When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?</s>112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?</s>
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?</s>At home alone - where were you?</s>As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?</s>Get out...</s>
On whose authority, Corporal ?</s>This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.</s>
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..</s>Leeloo..</s>
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.</s>No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.</s>
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!</s>Superior numbers, kid!</s>

You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?</s>I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!</s>No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?</s>
Mom, Vincent's not interested.</s>Oh, I'm captivated.</s>
So you think the dissertation will get published?</s>I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.</s>
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-</s>Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.</s>

What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.</s>I need to make a telephone call.</s>A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...</s>
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.</s>Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?</s>No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.</s>Well, what about this?</s>
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?</s>I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.</s>

Then teach me how.</s>No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.</s>
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?</s>Did you?</s>No.</s>CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.</s>It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.</s>You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.</s>It's still sick.</s>Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.</s>
Were you born in Havana?</s>Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house.

I tried calling last night but your father --</s>Evan Shaeffer's dead.</s>
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?</s>Not fear.  More like disgust.</s>Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?</s>There's no people like you in my crowd.</s>No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?</s>You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.</s>Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.</s>You're talking through your hat now.</s>Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.</s>You were a soldier?</s>I was an officer.</s>
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.</s>Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?</s>No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.</s>Right.  Will you help us?</s>
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?</s>That's where we came out.</s>It's a lot of money, Pam.</s>We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.</s>Still...</s>For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.</s>
Jesus.</s>You sure you can manage?</s>I got it.</s>Do you want me to carry your pack for you?</s>
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.</s>I don't give a damn.</s>

There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.</s>No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.</s>You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.</s>
Goodbye, Charlie.</s>Don't go, Susan.</s>Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.</s>Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!</s>
Me?</s>Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.</s>
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end.

You're a comedian?</s>Yeah. And an actor.</s>I'll have to come see you sometime.</s>If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.</s>It's not going to well?</s>When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.</s>Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?</s>...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...</s>Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?</s>Why, you like the duck with the cigar?</s>Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?</s>Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.</s>Hey, at least it's not Goofy.</s>
Dwayne please calm down!</s>Calm down --</s>
Oh, she was here.</s>Where'd she go?</s>Out some place.</s>
You know, you could work in a wine store.</s>Yeah, that would be a good move.</s>

It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.</s>Can't you tell?</s>Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.

Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.</s>Great.</s>

Good afternoon--</s>Glad to see you again.</s>
I was a great dancer...</s>A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.</s>Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...</s>Unless what?</s>No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.</s>It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.</s>You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.</s>
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.</s>Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.</s>

Do you know where they're taking him?</s>Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.</s>
What have you come up with on the riddle?</s>"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.</s>Maybe, but I don't think so.

Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!</s>Excuse me, Sergeant.</s>Yes, Reverend?</s>What do you want with those two medical officers?</s>They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.</s>
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!</s>But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.</s>You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are.

Is she...alright?</s>I thought she was dead. For sure.</s>
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...</s>John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.</s>
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?</s>... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...</s>The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...</s>That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...</s>What kind of concerns?</s>We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.</s>
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...</s>Twelve.</s>
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?</s>Yeah. We were just passing out guns.</s>Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!</s>
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.</s>Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam?

Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.</s>We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.</s>What do you mean?</s>PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.</s>Oh, they knew.  They had to know.</s>Show me the document that proves that.</s>
Haven't we been doing our homework.</s>I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.</s>

What's happened??</s>The documents are forged.</s>No!</s>Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!</s>It can't be true!</s>We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.</s>I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...</s>I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.</s>I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?</s>Italian is practically the same thing.</s>
And then shut down the pipe lines.</s>Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.</s>Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?</s>
That's affirmative.</s>Ga get it.</s>
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!</s>How yo doin', Gabe!</s>
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...</s>Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.</s>
This line is tapped so I must be brief.</s>The agents --</s>They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.</s>What do you know?</s>You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.</s>
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.</s>Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.</s>Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.</s>
What does he want that bloody great country place for?</s>Entertaining.</s>What kind of entertaining?</s>Now you're asking.</s>
...at all.</s>I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.</s>
Why were the other two women killed?</s>Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.</s>
Who knows what that is?</s>A Jewish prayer.</s>Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?</s>
What do you want?</s>I'm sorry.</s>What do you want?</s>My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.</s>You do?</s>Everything else means nothing to me.

Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.</s>I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?</s>
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.</s>Really?</s>Yeah.</s>Very well.</s>

That's how you get to be Spanish.</s>How 'bout the Sheriff?</s>The Sheriff.</s>The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--</s>I'm unmarried. I'm not available.</s>You told me one time it was true love.</s>

The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.</s>I'll bet.</s>In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.</s>
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.</s>To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.</s>
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.</s>So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.</s>

Just back up.</s>I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?</s>
A soft side? Who knew?</s>Yeah, well, don't let it get out</s>So what's your excuse?</s>Acting the way we do.</s>Yes</s>I don't like to do what people expect.

This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?</s>I ain't no preacher anymore.</s>All right, you remember the *man* then.</s>
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.</s>Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.</s>
What's the scoop, ace?</s>I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.</s>
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...</s>You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.</s>
Don't start.</s>You think I --</s>I have no idea.</s>What's on your mind? Don't --</s>It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it.

Is that what you're trying to say?</s>It's a starting place.</s>Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?</s>If you're going to insult me --</s>What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.</s>
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...</s>...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...</s>

Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state.

If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.</s>And what if amateurs try it?</s>I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?</s>No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.</s>
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.</s>You're a fucking alarm clock.</s>I just wish she'd get here, that's all.</s>She's here.</s>
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?</s>Depends if my date wants to stop by.</s>That junior chick?</s>Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.</s>Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.</s>Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!</s>Bullshit.  From where?</s>She works part-time at my dad's store.</s>Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.</s>Dude, he does not.</s>

I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.</s>Oh, no, really, I --</s>Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.</s>
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.</s>Not the better half.</s>
What's the matter?</s>It's all microchips and shit ...</s>Yeah?</s>
And you got to him before we could.</s>I killed him???</s>You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!</s>I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.</s>
What are you blubbering about?</s>I don't know...</s>
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.</s>I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!</s>Listen man, I don't need this shit--</s>
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?</s>Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.</s>What happened, Doolittle?</s>Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!</s>
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...</s>No, I wanna kill my boss!</s>Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.</s>
Well, we can take my truck then.</s>No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.</s>
God almighty. What did you do to me?</s>I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.</s>I had this weird flash just then.</s>What?</s>I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?</s>Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.</s>Louis, you're a life saver.</s>I know.</s>
No.  Here.</s>Separate incidents?</s>
What're you doing down here?</s>Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.</s>I know.</s>How do you know?</s>Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.</s>

Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...</s>Altitude fifty kilometers...</s>Entering the upper ionospere...</s>There's a red light on the second intake valve.</s>Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...</s>
You think the extra strain caused it?</s>Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.</s>
For what?</s>Honesty.</s>

I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.</s>I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.</s>Play one.  Educate yourself.</s>
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.</s>She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.</s>Fine —— you want to stay here?</s>
You're lying.</s>No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.</s>

One-handed!</s>Difficulty rating?</s>
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?</s>Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.</s>
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.</s>Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.</s>
You don't take another man's place, boy.</s>It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --</s>
How can you tell?</s>R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --</s>
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.</s>There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.</s>No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.</s>
What's this? December 8th, 1958?</s>I don't know, Dad doesn't either.</s>Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.</s>This is one of my favorite things, her passport.</s>Oh Vada she's so beautiful.</s>

So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?</s>Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.</s>
All these in the last year?</s>You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!</s>I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.</s>Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.</s>This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?</s>Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.</s>Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?</s>Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?</s>What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?</s>These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?</s>What if I petitioned one of the Directors?</s>You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.</s>Where do our records go to in the Castle?</s>We're a medical firm, aren't we?

There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.</s>What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?</s>I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.</s>Is there no way they can get back to you?</s>Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.</s>
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --</s>You loved him.</s>Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.</s>You were going to be married.</s>How did you know that?</s>I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.

He wouldn't leave me alone.</s>You were afraid of him, weren't you?</s>He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.</s>Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?</s>A legendary monster called Mbwun.</s>A monster?</s>Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.</s>What happened?</s>No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.</s>

... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?</s>See?  No code.  What'd I say?</s>Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...</s>

No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?</s>What did you hear ?</s>Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.</s>I was.</s>Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?</s>There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.</s>I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?</s>What are you looking for ?

I guess we open it.</s>Maybe we should knock first?</s>
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.</s>Seriously?  What did they say?</s>They said five hundred.  I said six.

Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?</s>There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.</s>So what's his reason?</s>Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.</s>She's saving herself for you.</s>Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?</s>I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?</s>Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...</s>Which is you...</s>So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.</s>

They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?</s>Because what I am interested in is right here...</s>What would you have me do?</s>
So go.</s>I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.</s>What if you stay this time?</s>I walked out the door. There's no more memory.</s>Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.</s>
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.</s>I am from outa town.</s>No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.</s>

Please.  Don't humiliate me further.</s>Let me help.  I can take care of everything.</s>No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.</s>How can you say that?  You know it's not true.</s>Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --</s>My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.</s>With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.</s>Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.</s>Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.</s>
Maybe if I used my left....</s>No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.</s>

Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.</s>Here is now there. There is here.</s>
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.</s>I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --</s>Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!</s>You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!</s>
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.</s>You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.</s>These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?</s>We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.</s>
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.</s>Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.</s>And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.</s>
Great.  All right...</s>...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...</s>...tight!</s>INT. TUNNEL - DAY.</s>
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.</s>But you didn't.  Why not?</s>I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.</s>

Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.</s>No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.</s>What would you like to have me do?</s>Sock her!</s>
This isn't working out.</s>We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.</s>"We're" not over-reacting.</s>Could you watch Jango?</s>No.</s>I can't take him to work.</s>
The other thing is...</s>...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.</s>They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.</s>We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.</s>
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.</s>They will know you helped us, if we go this way.</s>That doesn't matter now.</s>
Jesus creeping shit!</s>Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!</s>We wandered into a fucking time capsule!</s>
That's good.</s>Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.</s>Yeah. But not any more.</s>Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?</s>
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.</s>It would be too hard.</s>
Can I take off my clothes now?</s>No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.</s>Do you really want me to?</s>Yes I do.</s>I got up.</s>
What were we saying?</s>This isn't rare!</s>By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.</s>

Is it over ?</s>Almost. Look, you two get out of here.</s>Where ?</s>In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.</s>
Why didn't he want to sell it?</s>I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.</s>
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?</s>Uh, no.</s>Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?</s>
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.</s>Sit down, Frank.</s>No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.</s>
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.</s>What difference will it make?</s>Just wait here.</s>
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?</s>BRIAN...</s>But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?</s>
Will we see a worm?</s>Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.</s>Always?</s>Always.</s>Why do they come?</s>To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?</s>
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.</s>No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?</s>I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?</s>Just listen to me.  If I said to you --</s>"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --</s>Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?</s>Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...</s>
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?</s>He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.</s>No.  Did he really?</s>Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...</s>What?</s>That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.</s>That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.</s>
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.</s>Thanks, I'll be fine.</s>

No, I don't.</s>That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.</s>I can hardly wait, Coco.</s>
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?</s>The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.</s>My equations are not parlor-tricks!</s>Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?</s>Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!</s>
Sorry man...</s>S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.</s>
I'm not kidding.</s>Okay!!!! Anything else?!?</s>Just how grateful I am.</s>
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".</s>I was?</s>You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?</s>
...didn't you?</s>No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....</s>

You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.</s>Since when?</s>Since I made Lieutenant.</s>
We'll have to sneak in.</s>No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.</s>Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.</s>
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.</s>Are you speaking to me in a code?</s>No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.</s>In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.</s>

Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.</s>Get out of my way.</s>Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.</s>Forgive?!</s>Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.</s>They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!</s>
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.</s>Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.</s>Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.</s>I'm confused.</s>No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.</s>

I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.</s>What?</s>I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.</s>Are you kidding?</s>No, I'm not kidding.</s>You can't just walk off onna girl like that.</s>
Jesus! What?! You want money?!</s>Shut the fuck up.</s>
I'll have to pay him back.</s>I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.</s>I'm not even listening.</s>You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.

My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.</s>Why not?</s>These new personality corrections I've been reading about.</s>You worried about the cost?</s>Not that.</s>They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.</s>
Why are you doing this?</s>Doing what?</s>Robbing a bank.</s>I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?</s>

You can't say that....</s>The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?</s>
Maybe we could try it this way.</s>Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.</s>I hope so my darling.</s>

You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.</s>You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?</s>
Any sign of the hostages?</s>We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.</s>
You sure this goes somewhere?</s>Truman used it all the time.</s>

Where?</s>I think it only said where -- but I can't --</s>Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.</s>That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.</s>Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.</s>Of course there is!</s>There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?</s>Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.</s>

I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.

Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...</s>What kind of doubts?</s>About you... your background and your qualifications.

I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.</s>Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?</s>I don't know what to do.</s>You know what your problem is?

You remember your price, Stamp?</s>Never found out.</s>I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.</s>No use thinking these things now.</s>Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?</s>Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.</s>They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born.

I won't.</s>There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.</s>
Suicidal...</s>The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.</s>

What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?</s>Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --</s>He has Phil right now.</s>Phil's one of the nurses from the service?</s>Yeah.</s>If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --</s>-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --</s>We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?</s>I'm listening.

Did you bring the first aid kit?</s>Yes.</s>Flares?</s>Absolutely.</s>We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.</s>That's very funny.</s>I love you so much.</s>
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?</s>Hmm. Good night.</s>

It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.</s>You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.</s>What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment.

I've got you, Dr. Evil!</s>Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.</s>No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.</s>Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.</s>That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.</s>Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.</s>

How... how can you say that to me...?</s>Will you let me look?</s>My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...</s>You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?</s>
Scottie!</s>How does it work?</s>Can't you see?</s>Oh, yeah. There.</s>
See you later.</s>Where you off to?</s>Las Vegas.</s>

Beautiful day, isn't it?</s>How can you be out here?</s>I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.</s>
Like what?</s>Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!</s>Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?</s>Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.</s>Why?</s>Because I have to!</s>What are you going to use for money?!</s>I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.</s>Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?</s>Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.</s>Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!</s>No.</s>Oh, yes, you have!</s>No.</s>You've been with someone!</s>Stop accusing me!</s>
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.</s>Why should he forget it?</s>
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?</s>What's that, Johnnie?</s>The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...</s>
A satellite dish?</s>Well I was just throwing out ideas...</s>
You make videos?</s>Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.</s>You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."</s>"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.</s>You could do it.</s>I could.</s>Yeah!</s>Yeah.</s>I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?</s>Yes!</s>Yeah!</s>A reel?</s>
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.</s>When'd you do it?</s>While you were sleeping.</s>
What's the matter?</s>Oh, Peter—</s>What's got into you?</s>Oh, Peter! I was so scared.</s>
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?</s>No. That makes you keep searching.</s>
Are you following me?</s>I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.</s>Hi</s>
About a dozen.</s>A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.</s>
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...</s>And now Jonathan Masbath.</s>Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?</s>He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.</s>
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.</s>Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.</s>
Please!</s>But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?</s>
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?</s>NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.</s>
What do you know about Michael?</s>I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.</s>Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --</s>No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.</s>
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.</s>Dr. Lecter -</s>I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.</s>You know I can't make that promise.</s>Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.</s>

Wow. That shirt is working hard.</s>Is Vanessa here?</s>Nope. We're safe.</s>
What's this?</s>A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."</s>Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.</s>
Foley?  That you?</s>How are you, Richard?</s>Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?</s>Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.</s>Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.</s>
Calvin!</s>Coming!</s>
Too far?</s>If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.</s>
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?</s>Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?</s>How much do you make a week?</s>Huh?</s>How much do you make a week? What's your salary?</s>Forty dollars.</s>
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --</s>Cut it out!</s>
Get it out of here!</s>Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.</s>Makes no difference. Get him out!</s>Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...</s>That's easy. Me.</s>I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!</s>On his back, I suppose.</s>No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.</s>You're too good to me.</s>Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?</s>No —- not yet.</s>And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.</s>Get it out of here!</s>Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.</s>Makes no difference.  Get him out.</s>Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.</s>That's easy.

I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.</s>Yes, I would.</s>God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'</s>Okay.</s>
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.</s>Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.</s>
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.</s>I was crossed-trained in gunships.</s>
Like the Genie in the bottle.</s>Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.</s>
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.</s>Do you know?</s>
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....</s>I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....</s>
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.</s>Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.</s>Better call an ambulance first.</s>
Hi!</s>Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.</s>Right... OK...</s>
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.</s>Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.</s>Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?</s>
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.</s>He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.</s>We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.</s>It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.</s>
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.</s>So Suzie, you called us, remember?</s>
Here.</s>What's this?</s>
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...</s>Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...</s>
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.</s>His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;</s>He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.</s>That plane goes to Miami...</s>I want it met.</s>Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.</s>I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...</s>Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.</s>I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?</s>Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?</s>They are everywhere!</s>I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.</s>I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.</s>Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.</s>Good.  Then you're staying.</s>I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.</s>
We are being hailed.</s>Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.</s>
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.</s>For what?</s>You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?</s>What choice?</s>If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?</s>
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.</s>You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.</s>No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.</s>
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.</s>All she needed for that was the phone book!</s>No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.</s>When I find out who that phony bitch was.</s>
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.</s>Just, just take it easy, Walter.</s>That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.</s>Well, just take 't easy, man.</s>I'm perfectly calm, Dude.</s>Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!</s>Calmer than you are.</s>
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.</s>Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.</s>
I thought I'd help out.</s>We don't need you.</s>That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.</s>
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.</s>Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...</s>
Where am I?</s>You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.</s>WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?</s>The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.</s>Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!</s>You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.</s>Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?</s>A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.</s>Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?</s>We won, Austin.</s>Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!</s>
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.</s>They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.</s>That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.</s>
Life is good.</s>Life is good.</s>
What is it, mother?</s>I wish to discuss your brother.</s>He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.</s>First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.</s>I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.</s>He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.</s>Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!</s>Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.</s>You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.</s>
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.</s>Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.</s>
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?</s>No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.</s>I didn't expect anything.</s>That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --</s>Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.</s>You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --</s>It was just words.</s>But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.</s>I'm trying, David.</s>So am I. My friends were killed, too.</s>I am truly sorry.</s>
Hi.</s>I heard you might be moving back...</s>Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...</s>I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?</s>I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.</s>Goodbye. I lov...</s>
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?</s>Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.</s>
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.</s>That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.</s>Did you even to try to negotiate?</s>These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.</s>All I'm saying --</s>-- This conversation is over.</s>
I'm scared.</s>There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.</s>
How many you see?</s>One or two.</s>Audrey?</s>
How ya doin'?</s>Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.</s>
Where'd you get this, darling?</s>It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?</s>She was very pretty.</s>What's her name?</s>Irena.</s>Irena.</s>Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.</s>All right, mommy.</s>
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.</s>Please...this solves nothing...please....</s>
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.</s>Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.</s>They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.</s>
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.</s>You know who I am?</s>Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.</s>I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.</s>You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.</s>Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.</s>What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?</s>It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?</s>
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.</s>I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...</s>You gotta go, we're pinned down!</s>
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.</s>A mark, huh?</s>
Well, sure I do.</s>When'd you see him last?</s>Today, over at the house.</s>That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.</s>
Range twenty meters.</s>Seal the door.</s>
That's where we're going.</s>Why?</s>

Been away a lot.</s>Where else?</s>
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?</s>Hilarious.</s>
Shit yeah, the achievers.</s>Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive</s>
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.</s>Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.</s>

Did I wake you?</s>I'm up.</s>I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.</s>Why?</s>He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?</s>Give me twenty minutes.</s>We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.</s>
Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?</s>Uh-huh.</s>
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.</s>That was very well put, Ted.</s>

Oh my God.</s>Well, it's finally happened.</s>
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.</s>... until he found tungsten.</s>

Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?</s>Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?</s>I suppose that would be okay.</s>

What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?</s>You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.</s>How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?</s>Do what, Mr Lombard?</s>Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.</s>I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.</s>I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.</s>Then you should not have sought an explanation.</s>I presume you checked your son’s apartment...</s>Yesterday. It all looked normal.</s>Did you look for his passport, driving licence?</s>Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.</s>So he could have decided to go on a trip...</s>He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.</s>Then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?</s>
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.</s>Sounds delightful.</s>

Is this boyfriend bothering you?</s>I don't have a boyfriend.</s>The gentleman who came to the door --</s>-- is not my boyfriend.</s>Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --</s>It's not -- what's a 422?</s>It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --</s>It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.</s>I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.</s>You won't.  You won't have to.</s>But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!</s>

The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."</s>What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse.

Is it for real?</s>Get Fox.</s>
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.</s>At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.</s>The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.</s>Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.</s>
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.</s>Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.</s>Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.</s>

Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.</s>That's what Tim said.</s>So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself.

All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.</s>
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?</s>For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!</s>

Mama, what was we laughin' for?</s>At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!</s>

The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.

That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me?

Can I have this room daddy?</s>Sure.  Did you see the others?</s>I want this one, daddy.</s>Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.</s>
What's the catch?</s>Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...</s>

It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?</s>Oh yes, my lady.

He's not as tough as he looks.</s>Then what good is he?</s>Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?</s>Is that a problem?</s>Not for you, clearly.</s>I'm loyal to things that make me happy.</s>Am I a thing?</s>Well, you're certainly not a person.</s>I'm not.</s>No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.</s>I'm so glad we're having this chat.</s>It's not a knock.</s>It's not a compliment.</s>It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?</s>As soon as you get dressed.</s>What kind of food?</s>Anything but Japanese.</s>Why?</s>I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.</s>Like you.</s>I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.</s>You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.</s>It's just fuel to me.

There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!</s>Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.</s>I've tried that!

There's so much we have to talk about.</s>I would be interested to know what we are talking about.</s>Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.</s>
See Threepio... do you copy?</s>I read you sir.</s>You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?</s>I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.

Five thousand dollars.</s>Okay, I think I could swing that.</s>

Why am I here?</s>They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.</s>With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.</s>Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?</s>Well, when you put it that way.</s>Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?</s>I like a woman who takes control.</s>

I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.</s>
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.</s>Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.</s>However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.</s>And I won't be a communist anymore.</s>Exactly.</s>So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.</s>
They're gone.</s>Dee?  What are you doing here?</s>
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.</s>I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.

I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.</s>You seem to know all about my destiny.</s>I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.</s>You love her that much?</s>Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.</s>

Good morning.</s>Good morning.</s>Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.</s>Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.</s>I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market.

We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.</s>They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!</s>
My lady!</s>Who is there?</s>Will Shakespeare!</s>
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?</s>Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!</s>Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!</s>
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?</s>No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!</s>
Go even crazier?</s>I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!</s>Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?</s>I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --</s>
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?</s>I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.</s>You'd recognize it if you tasted it.</s>I doubt it, darling.</s>Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...</s>You want to keep him happy.</s>If he's happy...  I'm happy.</s>
Who wants fruit salad?</s>I do, please.</s>That's not gum in your mouth, is it?</s>It's sugarless.</s>You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...</s>Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.</s>
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.</s>Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.</s>
Where do you want to do this?</s>Probably the bathroom.</s>Can't you do it out here?</s>
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.</s>You were his friend.  One link is all they need.</s>
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!</s>But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!</s>
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?</s>Yes.</s>He's dead, huh?</s>Yes.</s>I think this place stinks.</s>Our Lady of Misery.</s>Did you see my father?</s>No.</s>It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.</s>He's working a double shift.</s>Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?</s>
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!</s>And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.</s>
What are you doing here?</s>He wants to talk to you.</s>Now it's okay?</s>Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --</s>
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.</s>Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.</s>I don't want to waste your time.</s>Then don't.</s>I have a proposal for you.</s>
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.</s>Ask them.</s>I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.</s>
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?</s>Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.</s>
Jack.</s>Hi.</s>Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.</s>
Do you feel all right, sir?</s>Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.</s>
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.</s>Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?</s>Uh uh.</s>Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --</s>Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.</s>
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.</s>I don't know.</s>
How many?</s>Stop busting my hump....</s>Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....</s>I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....</s>
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?</s>My father was a sick man.</s>But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?</s>You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.</s>
Melvin Belli.</s>I was careless.</s>
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.</s>Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.</s>-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --</s>-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.</s>Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --</s>How much wine have you had?</s>-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.</s>You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?</s>No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!</s>
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.</s>Lie?</s>If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.</s>To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.</s>I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.</s>
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.</s>I don't know. I wouldn't know.</s>
You look as if you could.</s>Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?</s>You don't look eighty.</s>That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.</s>That's a nice teapot.</s>Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?</s>
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --</s>Go on in.</s>
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.</s>And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!</s>
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...</s>Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.</s>Follow the Rich White Man?</s>Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.</s>Follow the RichWhiteMan...</s>Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.</s>Who?</s>Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.</s>How do you know he's our man?</s>Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!</s>You sound like that all the time.</s>Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.</s>Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.</s>Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.</s>Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.</s>The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.</s>
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.</s>What?</s>She is not your birth mother, is she?</s>No, but... why do you ask that?</s>What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?</s>She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?</s>Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.</s>If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?</s>I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.</s>
You can't sell this to your friends.</s>Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.</s>Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.</s>
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.</s>I wanted to call.  I couldn't.</s>You couldn't?</s>You don't understand...</s>No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!</s>I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.</s>
Of course I do!</s>Name one.</s>God, KAREN JOHNSON.</s>One!</s>Your completely missing the point.</s>Hey!</s>I'm talking about idealism.</s>
And Buckaroo Banzai.</s>Come on--let's parole 'em.</s>
Howdy!</s>Howdy to you.</s>
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.</s>You may go, Smythe.</s>
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?</s>Fuck you, Philip.</s>
Next stop...</s>Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!</s>
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.</s>Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.</s>
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.</s>Lester - he called you here.</s>Right.</s>Here.</s>He was just on the phone.</s>He called you right here.</s>I just talked to him.</s>So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.</s>Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -</s>That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -</s>He's sittin' by the phone -</s>What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!</s>Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!</s>It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.</s>Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?</s>You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?</s>Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!</s>'Go! Go! Go!'</s>
WHAT?</s>Are you sure, Kenny?</s>
Lois, the kickback story...</s>Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.</s>I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.</s>
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.</s>I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.</s>No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.</s>
Who?</s>Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.</s>Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.</s>
Your investment ideas never work out.</s>That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.</s>
Yeah?  So?</s>It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.</s>
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?</s>Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.</s>
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.</s>What's that supposed to mean?</s>It means you're too hard on guys.</s>No I'm not.</s>Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.</s>
-- And keep your eyes on the road.</s>I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?</s>Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.</s>
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.</s>Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.</s>
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.</s>Sure.</s>
Is it the frank or the beans?</s>I think a little of both.</s>
Oh no. No, please.</s>What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.</s>
We're moving you tomorrow.</s>But I like the presidential suite.</s>Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.</s>So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?</s>That's the idea.</s>
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.</s>Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?</s>No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.</s>Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.</s>For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.</s>
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.</s>Really, that's a long time.</s>Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.</s>Yikes.</s>Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.</s>
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.</s>Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.</s>Could someone have hurt you that bad?</s>
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.</s>Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.</s>I guess there is a reason to fret.</s>
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....</s>It picked Sean...It killed your father....</s>Dad died from a heart attack....</s>He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....</s>
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --</s>What happened to her?</s>What do you mean?  She's not here?</s>When I woke up, nobody was here.</s>She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.</s>Her suit's gone.</s>Beth left?</s>I thought she was with you.</s>
What brought you down here, Greg?</s>Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—</s>Well, I'm glad you came to see me.</s>
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.</s>I look pretty.</s>Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...</s>
Have we met?</s>I don't think so.</s>Did you know Sebastian well?</s>You might say that.</s>Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.</s>That's right.</s>I'm sure you're going to love it there.</s>
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.</s>No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.</s>We took a walk three days ago.</s>Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.</s>
You know him?</s>Sort of.</s>
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.</s>This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.</s>He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.</s>I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.</s>Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.</s>What was she to Creasy then?</s>Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.</s>And they took that away.</s>A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.</s>
We've lost SEN!</s>What?</s>Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.</s>Too late....stay close.</s>
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.</s>Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.</s>
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?</s>Yes, Bob.</s>Did you say we saved ninety white people?</s>Yes.</s>Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.</s>You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.</s>Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants—  —and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.</s>
Anyone there?</s>No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.</s>
Martha, it's you.</s>What about Roger? He's free.</s>
Where's Laurie?</s>I don't think she's coming with us.</s>
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.</s>Yes.</s>Who am I?</s>Doctor Livingston.</s>And why am I here?</s>To help me.</s>Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?</s>Because I'm in trouble.</s>What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?</s>
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.</s>That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.</s>
What'dya think?</s>I think maybe I have more options than I thought.</s>
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...</s>It's no biggie.</s>
That was my favorite part!</s>We can do better. It needed more white.</s>
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.</s>Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?</s>Uh-huh.</s>I'm a writer myself, you know.</s>
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.</s>Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?</s>
Oh, shit.</s></s></s></s></s>Oh...</s>
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.</s>What?</s>
NO.</s>You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.</s>No.</s>You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.</s>
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.</s>Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.</s>
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.</s>Harold!</s>Close up shop!</s>
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.</s>Excuse me? Are you talking to me?</s>I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.</s>After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.</s>I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.</s>I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.</s>
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.</s>He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.</s>Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?</s>At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --</s>Jesus.</s>Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.</s>Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.</s>Who does?</s>
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.</s>I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.</s>Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?</s>A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.</s>
This is Wednesday.</s>Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?</s>Wrong day?</s>Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.</s>That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.</s>Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.</s>
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.</s>Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.</s>
You think they're connected?</s>I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.</s>
An unmarked police car.</s>How do you know?</s>I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.</s>
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?</s>Take some allergy medicine.</s>You can't believe this bullshit.</s>She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.</s>
What are you, a cop?</s>If I see you do it again, I'll report it.</s>I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?</s>Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.</s>So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.</s>You're talking about complicity.</s>I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.</s>
Are you finished with me?</s>For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?</s>No.  Not yet...</s>
How many, would you say?</s>Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.</s>You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.</s>
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.</s>I'm on it</s>Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.</s>I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.</s>
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.</s>Wish I could say the same thing.</s>
What's happening?</s>I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?</s>Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.</s>The money, Nels ... ?</s>
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?</s>I think we're falling in love.</s>
Hello, I'm calling from...</s>If you're selling something, I'm late for work...</s>I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...</s>From the magazine?</s>This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?</s>How come you're calling me from...?</s>This is Miss Costello...?</s>Yes. Price...</s>Pardon?</s>Kathy Price.</s>We find that your subscription lapsed...</s>My subscription lapsed three years ago...</s>That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...</s>Missus...</s>We have a renew-your-subscription offer...</s>We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.</s>Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...</s>No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.</s>
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.</s>Do try to sleep, Bob.</s>Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.</s>
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.</s>This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.</s>Why her?</s>She was . . . innocent</s>
What do you imagine this is?</s>Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?</s>
Did you see what I meant about the window?</s>Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.</s>That's true. But what if they change the locks?</s>Would they do that?</s>Who knows? That's why I filed it down.</s>
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.</s>So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.</s>
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!</s>Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?</s>
I'm going to the show--</s>I'll go with you--</s>
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!</s>Well...uh...</s>Shame on you!</s>Uh...yeah...sorry.</s>Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.</s>Strip?</s>Yes, slowly.</s>
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.</s>Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?</s>
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!</s>Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.</s>
She going to be all right, Doc?</s>How many pills were in that bottle?</s>It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?</s>
It's hard to go places, isn't it?</s>There's been an accident, Truman.</s>Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.</s>
Well, it don't look pretty.</s>But it's got teeth.</s>
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.</s>I doubt it. She's just an...</s>

In the old days we'd have had her flogged.</s>That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.</s>You just told me you hadn't seen her.</s>Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.</s>Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?</s>You can't imagine.</s>That bad?  Old or young?</s>Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris.

There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.</s>You saw all that in one glimpse?</s>Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!</s>Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.</s>

I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.

Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.</s>
What brings you here?</s>I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.</s>

Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?</s>Sure.</s>
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.</s>Mob?</s>Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.</s>So what? We hide, right?</s>What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.</s>You're pissed we didn't get credit?</s>No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating.

Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.</s>You don't understand anything.</s>I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine.

That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...</s>Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.</s>
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.</s>I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.</s>But what is it they don't like?</s>Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.</s>What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?</s>I think it's marvelous. Truly.</s>It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?</s>I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend.

He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.</s>You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.</s>Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?</s>We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.</s>Yeah. I sure know that.

Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?</s>I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.</s>Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?</s>You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.</s>Maybe I am dealing with it.</s>I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...</s>

And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."</s>Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom.

The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."</s>It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes.

Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.</s>Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit.

That would be a catastrophic mistake.</s>People hate Jews. Do you agree?</s>They used to. Today it's not an issue.</s>No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really.

You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.</s>And Betty Mayfield--</s>Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.</s>But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?</s>If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.

Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.</s>How's that, Sid?</s>It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --</s>Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --</s>Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing.

Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!</s>That right.</s>It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.</s>Huh.</s>That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...</s>

He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...</s>The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.</s>
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.</s>Thanks, I needed that.</s>I'll be back in 137 hours.</s>Have fun.</s>
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.</s>Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.</s>Eve, she strangled a baby!</s>Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.</s>

Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.</s>Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.</s>
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.</s>Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.</s>Go with God.</s>
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?</s>What if we fall?  I hate trees.</s>
But, Father.</s>Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!</s>

Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.</s>But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.</s>Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?</s>
I said he hadn't written me.</s>Oh, then you did hear from him?</s>Well....</s>Well, what?</s>He telephoned me today.</s>He did!</s>I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.

This time I really don't see anyone man.</s>Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.</s>This. is killer.</s>
But I'm not a killer!</s>Your logic is backward.</s>

At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.

Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?</s>Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.</s>Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.</s>It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.</s>Are you saying she was-</s>I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.</s>
Hi, Jack.</s>Hi, David.</s>

I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.</s>Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.</s>I manage fine alone.</s>I deserve to help you.

That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.</s>Good.</s>
Is he dead yet?</s>No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?</s>Absolutely.</s>Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?</s>Sure thing.</s>You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.</s>Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.</s>

By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?</s>I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.</s>You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?</s>You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?</s>No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...</s>
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.</s>Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.</s>I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?</s>My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.</s>I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.</s>I'll come a-running, pardner.</s>

Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.</s>Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.</s>
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.</s>Where to?</s>I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.</s>Your dad's really gonna build his house?</s>I don't know.</s>Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.</s>
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?</s>I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.</s>Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.</s>
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.</s>And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.</s>
You want me to what?</s>I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.</s>It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.</s>You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.</s>What are you talking about?</s>I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow.

Poor Freddie.</s>Did you ever work with her?</s>Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.</s>Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.</s>She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.</s>
What time is it?</s>About eight o'clock.</s>
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.</s>I know.</s>I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.</s>The good stuff.</s>Yeah... you know...  Fucking.</s>Have you ever made love, Donald?</s>
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.</s>Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated</s>
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.</s>Anne, they're MY moods.

We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then...</s>I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.</s>Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.</s>That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...</s>I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.</s>
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.</s>Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.</s>

Take care of yourself out there...</s>I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...</s>Bill...</s>Huh?</s>Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-</s>I'll try.</s>You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-</s>Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.</s>- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.</s>How childish are you going to get before you quit it?</s>I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-</s>And cut that out right now.</s>Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?</s>As of this moment you're six years old...</s>
It's real, George.</s>There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?</s>I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...</s>Is there any possibility that it's a hoax?

Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.</s>Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.</s>Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.</s>
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.</s>Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.</s>
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?</s>Russian women prisoners?</s>

You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.</s>I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.</s>Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.</s>I tell you once again -- surrender!</s>It will not happen!</s>

A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.</s>How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?</s>What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.</s>
You were in insurance before the war.</s>Right. Claims assessor.</s>Conscientious, determined, dogged.</s>They said I was dogged?</s>Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.</s>Like this bandleader.</s>Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.</s>
Hello.</s>You looking for some action?</s>Well... I guess so.</s>All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.</s>

Yes, Ed.</s>Could we just talk alone for a second? I --</s>Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?</s>
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?</s>You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?</s>Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?</s>It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?</s>
No - I don't want it, thank you.</s>Why, you must drink! All poets drink!</s>
What do you think of the guinea fowl?</s>I'm a vegetarian.</s>Oh God.</s>

I'll see ya.</s>For half a million?</s>Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.</s>And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?</s>
You don't think I'm good enough?</s>What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.</s>Who?</s>An actress.</s>A rich actress.</s>Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.</s>But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!</s>I know, but --</s>What does Clifford say?</s>Right now we have to be practical.</s>Does Clifford even know?

Ya see, I ordered that special.</s>Tough titty, it's mine now.</s>Look, I'll trade you.</s>
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.</s>They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.</s>Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.</s>

What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.</s>Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.</s>

You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.</s>Make him stop.</s>
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.</s>It's not your fault.</s>
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.</s>That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.</s>
That ain't bad.</s>Tell him about Baldy.</s>
Who did it?</s>Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.</s>Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.</s>I have a gun.  It's under my bed.</s>You don't know what you're fucking with here.</s>Tell me.</s>
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?</s>Yeah.</s>Why do you need that much?</s>Well, what's the difference? I just need it.</s>Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...</s>I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.</s>Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.</s>
Hello?</s>Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.</s>NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.</s>What? Is there someone else?</s>

It's Skip, for you.</s>Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...</s>
I’m sorry?</s>I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.</s>
You talked to New York?</s>Yes</s>You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?</s>
I don't want to fight, George.</s>I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.</s>Bullshit.</s>I do, Jill.</s>
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.</s>Bluebell came in?</s>I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.</s>
It's not one of these?</s>You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.</s>Maybe you don't see my sign?</s>
I have to disagree.</s>I knew you would.</s>New worlds create new people.</s>Oh?  So you are a new man?</s>I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!</s>
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?</s>It was a gift... from my brother.</s>How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.</s>
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?</s>Give it to him.</s>
Yeah?</s>We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.</s>Who <u>are</u> you people?</s>I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.</s>I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--</s>Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--</s>He didn't.</s>We believe he did.</s>You're wrong.</s>We have good reason to believe that he passed you--</s>If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.</s>We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--</s>He didn't <u>give</u> me--</s>--otherwise we may have to--</s>Otherwise you may have to what?</s>We'd rather not--</s>Fuck you. You may have to what?</s>
Yeah.  Why not?</s>You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.</s>
Move away.</s>No.</s>Move!</s>No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.</s>
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.</s>Try to land on your feet.</s>
Use the fucking bomb!</s>So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.</s>I want to live for the three days.</s>
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.</s>You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?</s>Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'</s>Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?</s>Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...</s>
Who are you?</s>We hung out last night, remember?</s>I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?</s>Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.</s>
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?</s>Milo! What about --?</s>
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.</s>Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.</s>Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.</s>The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.</s>You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.</s>That'll be the day.</s>Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.</s>Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.</s>
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.</s>We need money first...</s>Yeah... Bobby you gotta...</s>
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.</s>Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.</s>

We had a tough year.</s>Yeah, nine years straight.</s>
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.</s>You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.</s>
How curious ...</s>Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.</s>
You know, maybe you should get some rest --</s>Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...</s>
Good morning.</s>Good morning.</s>
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.</s>Gary, don't worry, we --</s>Just do what I'm asking!</s>
How are you?</s>Scarred for life, that's how I am!</s>
What's happenin'?</s>They're comin' with us.</s>Pile in.</s>
17 years.</s>My God.

While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.</s>Listen...</s>
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.</s>I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years.</s>
Have you taken my message to him?</s>The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.</s>My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?</s>Your cousins go out with him.</s>
Anyway, you remember Harold?</s>Yeah, baby, how's it going?</s>
What's he smoke in that?</s>Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.</s>
Well?</s>I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.</s>You haven't tried locking them up!</s>You want 'em all arrested?</s>No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?</s>
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.</s>Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -</s>
How long have you worked for the Therrians?</s>A long time.</s>So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?</s>Oh yes.</s>Did you know the contractor?</s>Very well.</s>Was it a contractor?</s>It's the way they do things.</s>To code?</s>
You are truly magnificent!</s>Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...</s>
Dorota!</s>I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.</s>How are you doing?</s>Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.</s>Don't worry, it won't last long.</s>That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!</s>I'll see you...soon.</s>
What did she say?</s>I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.</s>Because...  ... you love her?</s>No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.</s>Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."</s>I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.</s>Did you like it that much?</s>It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.</s>Picking on me won't help.</s>Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.</s>But you know where you're lucky?</s>Absolutely not.</s>You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.</s>Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.</s>Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.</s>Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.</s>
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?</s>Joad. Tom Joad.</s>How many of you?</s>
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?</s>Yes.</s>
Please...help me...</s>Dad?</s>
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.</s>Lovely.</s>
Hiya, Doc.</s>Martin.</s>Did you straighten her out?</s>
I've done some questionable things.</s>Also extraordinary things.</s>Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.</s>
Are we going to build our little house?</s>Yes... a little white house.</s>Not white, darling.</s>All right, we'll make it red.</s>No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.</s>Right: Lovers of the world unite!</s>And we won't stretch up our arms...</s>No! No!</s>...and we won't clench our fist...</s>No! No!</s>Our salute will be a kiss.</s>Yes... a kiss... salute!</s>
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.</s>What for?</s>And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!</s>Oh, I'm sorry.</s>
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?</s>Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.</s>Rot in hell, Melvin.</s>No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.</s>
Oh, hi.</s>Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --</s>I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.</s>Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.</s>Of course. Please have a seat.</s>
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.</s>Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.</s>No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.</s>You really think so, Charlie?</s>That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.</s>They all say the cat killed this second girl.</s>They don't say it to me.</s>I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?</s>Sure.</s>Let's get in your truck.</s>
You think mafia hit?</s>Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.</s>It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.</s>Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.</s>And fifth, you're dating her.</s>
I'll order Riker to turn around.</s>Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?</s>
What do I do now?</s>Take a deep breath and hold it.</s>That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.</s>Just put your mask on.</s>
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.</s>Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.</s>Sure.</s>
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.</s>Okay...</s>
Shit.  Think we're had.</s>Smoke her.</s>I ain't gonna shoot her.</s>Only blanks.  Lemme do it.</s>Hey.  Ain't your call, man.</s>
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?</s>Not at all. Morning Tom.</s>Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...</s>
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?</s>I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.</s>Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?</s>Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.</s>
Welcome. 38</s>You're JP Monroe, right?</s>Uh-huh.</s>And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.</s>Thank you.</s>Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.</s>It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.</s>A prize?  For what?</s>You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...</s>The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?</s>He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?</s>I'm sorry.</s>Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.</s>Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...</s>Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...</s>
Was he a good detective?</s>I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.</s>
So there were others?</s>Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...</s>Then...when did she get better?</s>She didn't.</s>But you said...</s>That's where I'm going.  To see her.</s>She's in trouble?</s>Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?</s>
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...</s><u>Pay</u> her.</s>I don't got the money.</s>Find the money.</s>I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.</s>No no no no no no no no no find me the money...</s>
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.</s>This conversation is finished.</s>You said we could go to New York.</s>Did not.</s>Did too.</s>I can't know what I said, but we're not going.</s>I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.</s>Get out.</s>No.</s>Goddammit, I am sick of this --</s>
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.</s>I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?</s>Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.</s>It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.</s>Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.</s>
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.</s>I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...</s>Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's</s>gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.</s>Tonight?</s>That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.</s>
After he tried to shoot you?</s>He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.</s>He needed you, maybe.  So do I.</s>
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?</s>No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.</s>
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.</s>A window onto the human condition?</s>I prefer to think of it as a mirror.</s>
I don't know wh...</s>I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.</s>
Cameras?</s>No need.  Guards' station's right there.</s>
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.</s>We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?</s>
What's that?</s>_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.</s>So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?</s>Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.</s>How long will the effect last?</s>About ten minutes.</s>Ten minutes...</s>If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.</s>
What are you doing?</s>Pouring it out!</s>
How was the meeting?</s>Sobering...</s>Very funny.</s>Alice...</s>Since when are you such a smart shopper?</s>Since my little girl became a mom...</s>You disappointed in me?</s>No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.</s>
I know.  It's an awful lot.</s>I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.</s>
You know how to work this thing?</s>No idea.</s>Well, press something!</s>Wait!</s>
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.</s>But...</s>
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.</s>... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?</s>Or a vegetarian?</s>Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.</s>
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.</s>But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.</s>A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.</s>How can you store an energy field within you?</s>When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.</s>Don't you have a Kiber crystal?</s>I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...</s>That's where my father was killed.</s>Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.</s>Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?</s>They use the Bogan Force.</s>Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.</s>There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.</s>
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.</s>Thanks, Annie.</s>
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?</s>I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.</s>Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.</s>It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.</s>Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.</s>I never was more in earnest.</s>
And it would be the right thing to do.</s>Yeah yeah -- and that, too.</s>
My name is AL.</s>Al ???!!!</s>
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?</s>I'll stay awake.</s>All night?</s>All night.</s>
The country's loving it.</s>The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.</s>
Who told you that?</s>Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.</s>Has he gotten through to any?</s>No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.</s>
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...</s>What about tipping off Yurovich?</s>If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...</s>
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.</s>No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.</s>
Neat...</s>My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.</s>
Oh no?</s>Oh no.</s>It's not what I heard.</s>Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.</s>
What'd he look like?</s>Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.</s>
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?</s>Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?</s>No, thanks.</s>Good.</s>
Uh huh.</s>When?</s>Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.</s>
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!</s>Sorry, Kansas...</s>NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!</s>Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.</s>Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."</s>
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?</s>I guess.</s>
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?</s>Umm. Altogether?</s>Yes. Altogether.</s>Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.</s>How many times have you gone unprotected?</s>With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.</s>
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.</s>It could be -- the knife, and the saw.</s>
Are we...?</s>Are we what, Jack?</s>Is there something going on between us?</s>
Remember him?</s>He was a bit proud as I recall.</s>He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.</s>He turned out all right.</s>
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.</s>Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go.

I could help you.  I could get you off that.</s>Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?</s>
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?</s>Then there is nothing.</s>Perhaps...</s>
Were you also the one who painted the statues?</s>Oh, yes. How did you like that?</s>Well, I didn't.</s>Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.</s>But wait...</s>

I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.</s>What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?</s>
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.</s>Does she fuck?</s>I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.</s>
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.</s>What?</s>I know where your heart truly lies.</s>
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.</s>I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.</s>Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?</s>
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?</s>They were.</s>Well, it must have taken–</s>Centuries.</s>Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?</s>Of course we have no money as you know it.

Yeah?</s>Wade's here.</s>
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?</s>Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?</s>
You're living here?</s>'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?</s>Sure, I'll see what I can do.</s>

Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...?

The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.</s>How do I know I can trust you?</s>Dip me!</s>
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.</s>What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!</s>I think you're right.</s>Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.</s>
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.</s>So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?</s>

Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?</s>K is for Katharine.</s>
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.</s>Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..</s>

Will we always leave it at this?</s>Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.</s>I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.</s>Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.</s>Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.</s>My husband has convinced me of the contrary.</s>Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.</s>
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.</s>Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?</s>No Roger from op/ed?</s>Nope.</s>
You can't believe how much he's improved.</s>How many times have you shocked him tonight?</s>Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.</s>What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?</s>That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?</s>A medical miracle.</s>
Peter, you have to admit--</s>--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?</s>
Very pretty. Now what?</s>I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?</s>Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.</s>And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?</s>Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?</s>You're out, Dyle -- right now!</s>
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.</s>All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.</s>I wish I didn't love you so much.</s>

I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.</s>Why?</s>A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.</s>When did you decide?</s>It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.</s>
You gotta kill yourself.</s>I'll just go to Heaven.</s>
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.</s>Screw it, I'm going up anyway.</s>
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat!

Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!</s>But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.</s>What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?</s>
Daddy!</s>Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?</s>Fine.</s>
How are you?</s>Okay.</s>Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.</s>You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.</s>
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.</s>Okay.</s>
Which one is that?  Raw what?</s>This is mole.  It's good.</s>I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?</s>Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.</s>
Look at that.</s>Why are you being so mean?</s>I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?</s>
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?</s>Sure.</s>And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?</s>It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.</s>
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.</s>Twelve. Cross side.</s>
Would you like to try going--</s>Yes.</s>out again?</s>
Can I have another one?</s>I guess it wouldn't hurt.</s>
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!</s>Value? ... Value?</s>
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.</s>He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?</s>They do not have your connections.</s>Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.</s>
What class did you say that was?</s>History.</s>How'd you like that course?</s>Good, it was all right.</s>History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.</s>
Karen? You okay?</s>She can't talk right now.</s>
D'Artagnan, unready?</s>At a ball, everyone watches the King!</s>
Ouch.</s>I'm sorry.</s>
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.</s>Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....</s>Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....</s>I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....</s>
Lost?</s>Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...</s>Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.</s>
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing.</s>That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!</s>
What were you gonna do with me?</s>I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.</s>You waved to me in the elevator.</s>

Wait! I need those!</s>There is no softer ground than town.</s>
I remember the first time we met.

So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.</s>
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.</s>You want a queen? Got one right here.</s>
How're your hands?</s>Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.</s>You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.</s>Yeah, I know.  Me, too.</s>I mean, you can play.  You're okay.</s>I can keep the beat.</s>

The night we danced.</s>What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...</s>
You did create me.</s>No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.</s>Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.</s>You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.</s>
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?</s>Hello, my name is John Merrick.</s>

Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.</s>That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.</s>
Jack?</s>We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?

I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.</s>This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.</s>Are you getting tired?</s>Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.</s>

That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.</s>
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.</s>What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?</s>Never met him.</s>Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.</s>Amen to that.</s>
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.</s>There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.</s>
What did you say?</s>Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!</s>Not funny, Sam!</s>This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!</s>Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!</s>But, Mom...</s>Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.</s>No, I'm not...</s>There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --</s>-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!</s>
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?</s>Well, I --</s>I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.</s>
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?</s>Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?</s>Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.</s>
Mr. MacDougal.</s>You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.</s>
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.</s>Upset?  Why should I be upset?</s>Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.</s>
What?!  She wants what?!</s>She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.</s>John, what if she kidnaps him.</s>
First decent idea you've had in a month.</s>Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.</s>
You're perfect for me, too.</s>You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?</s>In a fire, as I recall.</s>Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.</s>
Wydell.</s>Excuse me for a second.</s>
Dignan.</s>Anthony. Bad news.</s>
You said 48 hours!</s>I never agreed to that.</s>Bob, you're lying!</s>Bullshit.</s>All right! Backyard! Right now!</s>
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."</s>What? Palace? Hardly.</s>Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...</s>
He talks about women as if they were cattle.</s>Every man to his taste, sir.</s>Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?</s>Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.</s>Twenty! What did he do with them?</s>That was something I was never able to find out, sir.</s>
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.</s>Can't we get a couple whores over?</s>
What?  What is it?!</s>The sky!!!</s>The sky?  Where?</s>Up there!!</s>I don't see anything!</s>Just look!!</s>
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.</s>You do know me.  You helped me once.</s>That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.</s>I'm here about some monkeys.</s>
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.</s>You're willing to die for this.</s>It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.</s>
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?</s>I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.</s>You hope this, too?</s>
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.</s>We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.</s>What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?</s>It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.</s>Us?</s>
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.</s>Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.</s>
Wow. You're a walking felony.</s>Thank you. Having fun?</s>Now I am.</s>I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.</s>That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.</s>Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.</s>Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.</s>
Yes.</s>Are you attracted to me?</s>Yes.</s>Why?</s>Why?  I don't know.</s>Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?</s>Both.</s>
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--</s>Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?</s>Do you know how I felt, Diz?</s>No. How'd you feel? Quick.</s>Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?</s>*I'm* just waiting for a street car--</s>Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?</s>I apologize.</s>*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.</s>Again? Good idea.</s>Diz--</s>Yeah.</s>How about getting married?</s>Good idea. When?</s>Any time.</s>Tonight?</s>Okay. You don't mind?</s>I'll cherish ya.</s>You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.</s>Tunnel?</s>You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?</s>Is the wind tired out there?</s>Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?</s>Have *you*?</s>No.</s>Do we *have* to?</s>No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)</s>Well, let's get going.</s>Where?</s>We're gonna get married.</s>Yeah--that's right. Diz--</s>What?</s>I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--</s>What?</s>My first name's--Clarissa.</s>Yeah, I know. That's okay.</s>Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.</s>Okay--I mean--</s>You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?</s>No--not offhand--</s>Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?</s>Susan? Nah!</s>I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.</s>You said it!</s>I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--</s>
He's going down.</s>That room!</s>What?!</s>PANIC ROOM!</s>

Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.</s>You're all hear.</s>I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?</s>Fuck you.</s>And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?</s>
David?... David!</s>Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.</s>Wait! Give me a chance --</s></s>
What's the point of this?</s>Does everything have to have a point?</s>It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.</s>
Do you like to read?</s>I can't read. Nobody taught me.</s>
Three ways, I figured.</s>No.</s>Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!</s>
What happened?</s>Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.</s>
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.</s>He was?</s>Yes.  He admitted it.</s>Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.</s>Why not?</s>You know how they are... sex...</s>Then just say he was sixty years old.</s>Is that what it means?</s>Of course.</s>
See that. They're gone!</s>Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.</s>Oh!!</s>
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.</s>'Love was... '</s>
I'll go into town with you.</s>Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.</s>No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.</s>
Tell you what, we'll jump together.</s>Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...</s>
Got you.</s>Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?</s>The shower's in there.</s>
You understand now? You see it clearly?</s>Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.</s>And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!</s>
I can't lose more than a hundred.</s>Just bring your card. Half an hour.</s>Wait.</s>What?</s>What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.</s>Oh...

There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.</s>You won't do that.</s>Why not?</s>Because you're having too much fun.</s>
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.</s>What the fuck are you talking about?</s>That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.</s>I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.</s>I'm not going to report it.</s>
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.</s>Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?</s>No.</s>James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...</s>Yul Brynner. They're all dead.</s>Yeah but they looked cool...</s>
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.</s>That's impossible.</s>Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?</s>
What do you mean?</s>Well, I assume you let him kiss you?</s>Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.</s>I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?</s>A little.</s>How much further?</s>Daddy!

Hello, Mr. Parker.</s>Hello.</s>How are you feeling?</s>Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.</s>He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.</s>What do you mean?</s>I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.</s>
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?</s>I suppose we'll make an appearance.</s>And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?</s>

Let's go.</s>Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!</s>Ilene, are you crazy?</s>I know what I'm doing... Go!</s>
If they are, they're screening their calls.</s>Range 3000 meters and closing.</s>
I'm interested. Keep talking.</s>All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.</s>
I'm going to the dance.</s>What for?</s>In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?</s>I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?</s>It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.</s>You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.</s>I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.</s>Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...</s>He did what he was supposed to.</s>But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.</s>Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.</s>I should have known.</s>
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?</s>I think we may be, yes.</s>
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.</s>His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.</s>Also known as Madman Mundt.</s>He's a little funny in the head.</s>
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.</s>Where is the meeting going to be?</s>At the ship.</s>
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."</s>The does it. It's going to be this weekend.</s>

Sergeant, secure the boat !</s>Yes, sir !</s>
It's a lie!</s>These walls do not lie! He will betray you.</s>He will not!</s>Then he will die!</s>
Is Johnny in?</s>No.</s>No?</s>
No problem. Look, I...</s>You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.</s>Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?</s>You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.</s>
I can arrest you!!</s>Then do it!!</s>You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.</s>So profound and fat.</s>
I have a bad feeling about this.</s>About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that...</s>I know we’ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.</s>
Hey.</s>Come over here.</s>
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?</s>Not too bad.</s>How 'bout when you went down the stairs?</s>
Good job, not pretty, but good.</s>Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?</s>
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?</s>First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.</s>Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?</s>As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.</s>Come on, that's impossible.</s>Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.</s>Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.</s>That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.</s>But if he said no before then...</s>Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?</s>
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?</s>How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?</s>Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...</s>
Terry!  You okay?</s>Help!  Help!</s>Okay, okay, coming....</s>
Say that again.</s>I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.</s>
Get down!  He'll see.</s>What's going on, Claire?</s>Shhhh.</s>
I thought you said you'd show me your place.</s>Not tonight.</s>
Aha. The Lovers.</s>Not lately.</s>
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?</s>What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!</s>
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?</s>I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.</s>You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?</s>Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.</s>What does that mean?</s>Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.</s>Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.</s>What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.</s>Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.</s>
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.</s>Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?</s>
What's happening up here?</s>I think it's fizzled out.</s>
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?</s>I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.</s>Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.</s>Oh, thanks.</s>Go ahead, Ricky.</s>
What's this?</s>See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.</s>
I don't know about that.</s>I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.</s>He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.</s>What lawyer?</s>
Walter --</s>Don't call me that.</s>Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.</s>Wrong answers?</s>There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.</s>Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.</s>
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.</s>I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.</s>She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!</s>Theo wants to talk again.</s>Did you have to tell her my name?</s>
There's nobody here. Jason...</s>Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.</s>
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.</s>I say we keep sittin' on Boca.</s>
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.</s>It is for me.</s>But not for me.</s>What do you want ?</s>I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!</s>
"See what's around you listen to their lies"</s>So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?</s>
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.</s>Faye Dunaway.</s>Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...</s><i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.</s>And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...</s>Peter Finch.</s>Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.</s>Bleeding on a country road.</s>It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.</s>
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?</s>Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.</s>
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?</s>Just lucky I guess.</s>
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.</s>Where is he?</s>Out in Oklahoma.</s>
So what?</s>The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.</s>
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?</s>There are no bond certificates.</s>What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?</s>No. What's the big deal?</s>Something is going down. Something bad.</s>Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.</s>
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.</s>How long have you been married?</s>

Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?</s>Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.</s>Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.</s>I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.</s>But you knew that I'd -- die.</s>Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.</s>
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.</s>What are you doing here?</s>I heard there was a poetry reading.</s>You 're so --</s>Pleasant?</s>
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.</s>My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--</s>Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?</s>
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.</s>What kind of a car is it?</s>
Wussup?</s>Wussup, Victor.</s>Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?</s>
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?</s>We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.</s>As in, your ass is dead in the water.</s>But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.</s>
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.</s>It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.</s>
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!</s>What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?</s>
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!</s>No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?</s>
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.</s>He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?</s>He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.</s>But if he knew we have so little time -</s>If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.</s>I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.</s>What would it take?</s>Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?</s>State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?</s>You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?</s>She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.</s>
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.</s>What's the message?</s>I have to tell you.  It's strange.</s>How do you mean, strange?</s>

If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...</s>What's "cynical"?</s>It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...</s>
Take me somewhere.</s>What?</s>Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.</s>How about Italy?</s>Yes.</s>How about Bari?</s>Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.</s>Have you ever been to that station?</s>Yes.</s>You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...</s>
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.</s>Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.</s>
We didn't tell him any different for years --</s>Your parents are divorced?</s>Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.</s>How do you -- the two of you -- get by?</s>Materially or spiritually?</s>Either. Both.</s>
The what?</s>The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?</s>
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!</s>No, for you! How old are you, Billy?</s>
What did you say?</s>I said... I started.</s>
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?</s>It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.</s>I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.</s>What?  But you been working so hard --</s>Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?</s>
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.</s>Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?</s>
I want to ask you a question.</s>Come in.</s>No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?</s>Because -- I am.</s>Is it because I'm here?</s>What do you think?</s>I think it is.</s>
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.</s>That your desk?  I'll take this one.</s>WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?</s>Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.</s>
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.</s>We need to hurry.</s>
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.</s>It does concern me.</s>Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.</s>How?</s>
I believe the operation is over.</s>The charge is murder.</s>
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?</s>The Rodger Young just burned up...</s>
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.</s>But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.</s>
What are we gonna do?</s>Destroy the evidence, Pronto!</s>
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!</s>Why do I have to pick up the tapes.</s>Jesus!</s>
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.</s>It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.</s>
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"</s>It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...</s>Let me call you back...</s>
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --</s>Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.</s>Hey, he cheated on her.</s>He made a mistake.</s>I don't want to -- do you know where he is?</s>No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.</s>No! And that girl has a name.</s>
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.</s>How can you tell it was deliberately buried?</s>By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.</s>Any clue as to what it is?</s>Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill</s>
Who paid you to see me off?</s>I can't Jack. How can I?</s>Yes you can.</s>
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.</s>Will do.</s>
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?</s>We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.</s>
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?</s>I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.</s>Yeah I know.  So what do we do?</s>
Wild card.</s>Drop the gun, Walter.</s>
I have to make him some chili. Okay?</s>Sure.</s>
Mr. Kessler?</s>Yes?</s>You haven't eaten your lunch.</s>I'm not very hungry, thank you.</s>I'm afraid you have to eat something.</s>Please, really. I'm not hungry.</s>You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.</s>How is that?</s>Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?</s>Leave the pills. I'll take them later.</s>Sorry.</s>
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.</s>Yes, ma'am, it is.</s>I'll give you fifty cents.</s>That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.</s>Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods!</s>
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?</s>I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.</s>You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?</s>
Excuse me?</s>Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?</s>He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.</s>I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?</s>
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.</s>Dead?</s>Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.</s>Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.</s>And some really fast cars.</s>
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.</s>It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -</s>
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?</s>You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?</s>Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.</s>I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father.

I've been trying all the firms, the shops...</s>Why didn't you come to me?</s>I didn't know you were in the certificate business.</s>I'm not, but Majorek is.</s>Can you help? I've no money...</s>Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?</s>
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.</s>What?</s>
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.</s>Let's grab some food.</s>First decent idea you've had.</s>
Who said they left then?</s>Who left -- where?</s>The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?</s>
Our little island seems to agree with you....</s>I have my own little island.</s>But it gets cold in winter....</s>
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.</s>Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.</s>These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?</s>
The deal.</s>The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?</s>I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...</s>
Today ain't my day.</s>Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.</s>
Have you a minute now?</s>No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.</s>Time's getting short.</s>I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.</s>
...Not even a 'thank you'?</s>Well -- I think you might consider</s>
A casual one.</s>Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.</s>Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.</s>
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.</s>Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--</s>in case I need it?</s>In case I need it.</s>
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...</s>You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.</s>
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.</s>You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.</s>
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?</s>Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.</s>Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.</s>Forty-five bills.</s>Hey, Terry, front and center.</s>
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.</s>In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?</s>Where the music's playing and the ladies are...</s>
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?</s>Dad, you there?</s>
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.</s>I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.</s>Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?</s>
This is a farce, man.</s>How is it a farce?</s>I seen your fucking face.</s>So, what do I look like?</s>You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.</s>Am I?</s>Yeah. And the brown eyes.</s>
How can I ever thank you enough?</s>Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....</s>
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight.</s>This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.</s>I know about what you mean!</s>This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?</s>Beautiful all over, eh?</s>And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.</s>
Everything on it?</s>Everything on it.</s>
What city?</s>Somewhere in Utah.</s>What's the listing?</s>D&D Mattress Man.</s>
Damnit... <u>What</u>?</s>I want you to follow Bud White.</s>Even I'm not that crazy.</s>It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.</s>Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.</s>Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?</s>Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.</s>You make a mistake?</s>Yeah.  My whole life.</s>
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!</s>Get out of here!</s>
You survived your first gay party intact.</s>Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.</s>Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.</s>Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.</s>
Anything special about the case?</s>When she...</s>
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.</s>Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.</s>I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.</s>If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.</s>Flowers!  What flowers?</s>
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --</s>He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --</s>It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?</s>
What about our grenades?</s>Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.</s>Would they notice and eighty-eight?</s>Sure, you got one?</s>The Germans do.</s>
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.</s>Why?</s>Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.</s>We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?</s>I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --</s>What is this bridge?</s>It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.</s>
Captain, are you all right?</s>Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.</s>
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.</s>Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.</s>
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?</s>Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?</s>Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.</s>That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?</s>Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.</s>Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .</s>
Sure. Have a good night.</s>I will.</s>
Shelly...</s>...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.</s>What about the other two?</s>What two?</s>Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...</s>...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...</s>...no...</s>...do you want to go downtown...?</s>...no...</s>...then...</s>...I only...</s>...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?</s>All that I'm saying...</s>
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.</s>I'm sorry.</s>Goodbye, Mr. Wells.</s>
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...</s>What have they got that we ain't got?</s>Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.</s>Me, too.</s>You don't seem very angry right now.</s>
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.</s>DELETE IN CUTTING</s>And I will lead.</s>
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?</s>I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.</s>Maybe you're happy.</s>Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.</s>
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...</s>Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.</s>I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.</s>Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.</s>All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...</s>Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.</s>I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.</s>
I've been working.</s>I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?</s>I'm sorry, David.</s>It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.</s>Then why are you here?</s>
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?</s>It's always locked.</s>But here you are inside, aren't you?</s>You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?</s>We tried to be.  We tried to be.</s>He's dead, you know.</s>Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?</s>
Mr. Abraham...</s>Abrams...</s>Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?</s>I'm fine.</s>Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?</s>Yes.</s>Ah.  How did they treat you?</s>
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...</s>Okay.</s>It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.</s>
You don't remember me, do you?</s>We know each other?</s>Oh, yes.</s>
Hi, Mike.</s>How you doing, Kelly?</s>I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.</s>Better than catching Sean's herpes.</s>
Oh, thank you.</s>The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.</s>Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.</s>
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.</s>Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?</s>
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–</s>Hey, Chili? Look at me.</s>
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.</s>And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.</s>
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.</s>Come on, George, let's hurry.</s>Did you get a doctor?</s>
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!</s>Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?</s>
She's plastered, isn't she?</s>She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.</s>I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?</s>Rosebud?</s>
Was she ever suspect?</s>No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.</s>
Don't you?</s>No.</s>Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!</s>
To your health, Frank.</s>Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.</s>If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.</s>
That's new, isn't it?</s>Couple of weeks... Listen --</s>I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.</s>
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?</s>Six years.</s>And would you describe those years as happy?</s>The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.</s>Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?</s>No, I did not.</s>Did you wish to?</s>Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.</s>Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?</s>Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.</s>And what is your present salary?</s>I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.</s>
She's angry.  It's all over the news.</s>Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.</s>You're not going to trial?</s>No.</s>Good.</s>
We was robbed.</s>Okay. Take her purse.</s>
Why?</s>One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --</s>
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.</s>So did we. Why didn't you come?</s>
Angela?</s>Yes?</s>I need to uh...</s>Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.</s>My little niece... she got this deep cough.</s>You take her to a doctor?</s>No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.</s>
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.</s>Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.</s>Okay... okay... get off.</s>
Where'd it come from ?</s>Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.</s>Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.</s>
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.</s>But big enough for us...</s>
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.</s>You already made the delivery?</s>No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.</s>What Friday?</s>What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.</s>
Let me see how you did that one.</s>Scram. Go home.</s>I can't. I just left home.</s>You're too young. You should be in school.</s>I am in school.</s>
Where'd you go to college?</s>I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.</s>She was willing to lick the stamps.</s>
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?</s>That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.</s>
Do you know what this is, Frances?</s>I ought to know.</s>What is it?</s>
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.</s>Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.</s>Something about a plane with no pilot?</s>
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.</s>Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.</s>
What do you want?</s>They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.</s>
We need an exit!</s>You're not far from Cypher.</s>Cypher, I thought --</s>So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</s>Got it.</s>
Any word from him?</s>Still no contact yet.</s>
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.</s>Well, I can't reach them.</s>
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.</s>You've got to go.</s>Why?</s>Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.</s>Your boyfriend?</s>
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?</s>My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.</s>Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?</s>Oh brother. Here we go.</s>Why not a hundred and fifty percent?</s>Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.</s>
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?</s>Yeah.</s>The NSA killed him.</s>Jesus. Do you have proof?</s>Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.</s>What's going on?</s>They're here.</s>Who?</s>Them.</s>Where?</s>Here?</s><u>Here</u>?!</s>In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.</s>'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.</s>
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.</s>What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .</s>Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!</s>Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!</s>
Do it!  Do it!</s>I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.</s>
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--</s>--so?</s>I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.</s>
He was with Gruner!</s>You were with GRUNER!</s>
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-</s>But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.</s>You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?</s>Eve. Eve Harrington.</s>
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.</s>What do you mean?</s>"Dracula."</s>
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!</s>Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.</s>
Welcome to our show!</s>Hack the Planet!</s>
There's a young girl to see you.</s>What does she want?</s>I don't know.</s>Well, ask her!</s>She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.</s>Oh, damn!</s>
Dog, I have found the cash!</s>The stupid bastards! Count it!</s>Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?</s>We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.</s>But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.</s>
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.</s>The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.</s>And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?</s>Ask him.</s>
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.</s>It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.</s>
Do you like the way I feel?</s>Yes.</s>See my breasts?  . See?</s>
Hi, honey!</s>Hi.</s>
One guess.</s>How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?</s>I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.</s>
I'm afraid not.</s>That's too bad.</s>
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.</s>Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.</s>Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...</s>You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!</s>
Oh, I shouldn't have...</s>It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.</s>That must have been awful for you.</s>
What are you doing?</s>This will relax her.</s>She's underage.</s>
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.</s>I'm just building up to it, Dad.</s>
Why are they doing this?</s>Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.</s>
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.</s>What?</s>
Come on, drink up.</s>I don't want any...</s>I insist...</s>I said I don't want any, goddammit!</s>
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !</s>It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.</s>Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?</s>Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?</s>
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.</s>Early, sing me a song.</s>
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.</s>Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.</s>Let's hope forever.</s>
Boss! Jesus! They've --</s>They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!</s>
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.</s>Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.</s>How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.</s>
He hates me.</s>Lucien Baines?</s>
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.</s>Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.</s>Lisbon?</s>In Portugal, yes.</s>
I'm busy right now.</s>It's important.</s>
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?</s>I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.</s>
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.</s>And a gymnast!</s>She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.</s>
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...</s>Friends?  You didn't tell me that.</s>You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?</s>
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!</s>Jake, I mean, come on --</s>
I really was way way too too.</s>Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?</s>I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.</s>
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.</s>How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.</s>
Stop that....</s>Stop what?</s>That....</s>I'm not doing anything.</s>
God, that's fine.</s>Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.</s>What were you listening to?</s>Allman Brothers.</s>What?</s>The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.</s>
Sshh.</s>I want my money back. Excuse me.</s>
It is now.</s>You can't just take it!</s>
No, Ben.</s>Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.</s>I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.</s>... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?</s>
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.</s>Thank you ever so.</s>You're welcome.</s>It's entirely mutual.</s>
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!</s>Or, perhaps, until he gets us?</s>
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!</s>What happened?</s>
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?</s>He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.</s>Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?</s>I'm not working on a plan.</s>You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.</s>Goodnight, Ray.</s>
You were late.</s>I'm really sorry.</s>What am I going to do?</s>You want to go talk to him?</s>Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.</s>
You telephone, sir.</s>...elephoned sir.</s>Trouble with your air-conditioning.</s>...ditioning.</s>
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.</s>It's not real...  That's not me.</s>Oh, please--</s>It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.</s>I think you should leave now, Robert.</s>Stacy--</s>Leave this house.</s>
What's she done?</s>You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?</s>Er ... no.</s>Very smart.</s>Er ... but I would've found out anyway.</s>Yes. I'm impressed.</s>Tell me about Layton.</s>She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.</s>A terrorist?</s>
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.</s>No, we're paying for the wine.</s>I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.</s>Well, in that case...</s>
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?</s>We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.</s>
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.</s>Yeah.</s>
You live in Manhattan?</s>Queens... You know Queens?</s>My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.</s>
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.</s>Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?</s>No, thank you.</s>
That was truly pathetic.</s>I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."</s>
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?</s>Okay--I don't know about this.</s>
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?</s>I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.</s>
Nowhere.</s>Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.</s>
You want to bring it down.</s>But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.</s>I'm not gonna kill anybody.</s>Hold that thought.</s>Why should I trust you?</s>You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.</s>You said they're destroyed.</s>I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.</s>What safe place is that?</s>The safest place of all.</s>
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...</s>Steady as she goes.</s>
Three ways?</s>Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?</s>Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.</s>
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...</s>If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!</s>Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.</s>I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.</s>Well what are we supposed to do?</s>I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --</s>
Shut up.</s>I didn't say a word.</s>
Thanks for coming.</s>I missed ya.  What can I say?</s>
Hey, you on television?</s>No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.</s>What's your name?</s>You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?</s>You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?</s>Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-</s>What's your name?</s>
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.</s>Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?</s>
Thought you were going to bring her.</s>So did I.</s>
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.</s>She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.</s>Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!</s>This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.</s>
Are you out of your mind?</s>I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...</s>Annie goes to a great school.</s>I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...</s>Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?</s>This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...</s>I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?</s>No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.</s>Jack.</s>
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?</s>Like this!</s>
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.</s>Meaning?</s>
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?</s>Are we boring you?</s>
You're really cramping my style here.</s>You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --</s>Sweet.</s>That's the temperature of the sun.</s>
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.</s>Are you joking?</s>Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...</s>
What's wrong, Trev?</s>Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-</s>And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.</s>
I'm not a baby.</s>You're a big girl, huh?</s>I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.</s>
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...</s>IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!</s>
I got your message.  Where's Craig?</s>I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!</s>You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?</s>Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!</s>Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?</s>I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.</s>
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.</s>Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--</s>Actually, it didn't come from me.</s>
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.</s>So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!</s>
Oh, yeah!</s>Right!</s>
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.</s>You?</s>Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.</s>
Sera... what you don't understand is...</s>What?</s>
Let's go and muck in.</s>Aye, before anyone stops us.</s>
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -</s>No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.</s>
Holy shit.</s>Lemme see the map.</s>
Remember the departure time?</s>Like... 4:25.</s>
This is a great song.</s>You remember it?</s>
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...</s>No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?</s>
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --</s>Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.</s>
Now, monsieur, you have no right...</s>Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.</s>
Hello, Lionel.</s>You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.</s>You're right, as usual. See you.</s>
Nothing is going on with us, is it?</s>Going on?</s>When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.</s>What did I say?</s>That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?</s>That was the truth.</s>You've never said that before.</s>I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.</s>It sounded like a pick-up line.</s>I can't pick you up.</s>
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.</s>What is it?</s>It's delicious, trust me.</s>Does it have wheat in it?</s>I don't think so.</s>
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.</s>Died?</s>A car accident.</s>Jesus, Jesus! ... When?</s>Last month, before Thanksgiving.</s>How did it happen?</s>No one knows. They say it blew up.</s>Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?</s>
And I don't even know your full name.</s>Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.</s>And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.</s>Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.</s>I hate Sadie.</s>Well you'll always be Sadie to me.</s>Always?</s>Getting late.  We better get back.</s>
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?</s>Yeah</s>
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.</s>Maybe he was a lousy shot.</s>
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!</s>What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.</s>Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.</s>I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?</s>
Atomic fuel?</s>Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.</s>
Bugs.</s>Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?</s>
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."</s>What?</s>What are you doing down there?</s>My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...</s>...lost the screw...</s>You got a paperclip?</s>
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...</s>Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...</s>
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.</s>When does this conference start?</s>According to my information, today.</s>Thank you, Captain Sulu.</s>Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.</s>
What?</s>Who fixed your ducts?</s>
Y-yes.</s>Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!</s>
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...</s>Where you goin?</s>I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.</s>Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?</s>Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.</s>Ok.</s>Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?</s>Ok.</s>
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.</s>Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.</s>
No, sir.</s>Excuse me. What did you say?</s>
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.</s>I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...</s>
She'll be out in a moment.</s>Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --</s>
Think we can make it?</s>We make it, or we go back empty handed.</s>
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.</s>His brother.</s>
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?</s>Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.</s>You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.</s>
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.</s>breaks down into heavy sobs.</s>
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?</s>Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.</s>Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--</s>
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.</s>Now don't kid a kidder.</s>
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?</s>Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.</s>
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -</s>The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.</s>They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -</s>I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -</s>Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?</s>Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -</s>I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried.</s>
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?</s>I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.</s>
This is great!</s>This is exactly what I wanted.</s>Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.</s>You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.</s>Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?</s>Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.</s>
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?</s>Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -</s>
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.</s>Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.</s>
What was <u>that</u>?</s><u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.</s>The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?</s>Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.</s>I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.</s>Maroon, right?</s>Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.</s>What the hell would they want with a gag factory?</s>Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.</s>
I have the whole weekend off.</s>Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --</s>
God damn you!!</s>Yes.</s>
You're going to burn up in those.</s>The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.</s>
Well, it all started when a friend and I</s>China</s>
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?</s>Yes, it is.</s>
What?</s>I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.</s>
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.</s>That just doesn't make any sense.</s>I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.</s>I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...</s>You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!</s>
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.</s>We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.</s>I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.</s>
Welcome home.</s>Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?</s>
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.</s>Look, I know a little bit about sharks.</s>Do you?</s>I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....</s>
Do you ever think about starting over?</s>All the time.</s>Can you tell me about it?</s>
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.</s>She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?</s>
I made a mistake.</s>What?</s>I made a mistake.</s>What about?</s>Never mind.</s>
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.</s>I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.</s>
He said it was a clue?</s>Maybe something to do with Zorro.</s>Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?</s>Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.</s>This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?</s>
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -</s>Yah, I don't need no sealant though.</s>Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -</s>
Where are you going, Sebastian?</s>Just thought I'd...</s>No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.</s>
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!</s>Today coffee----</s>TOMORROW THE OIL!</s>
You know you can come under the blanket.</s>It's alright.</s>
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?</s>I don't know.</s>
No, Jesus, no.</s>Toss the flare down!</s>
Yeah.</s>I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...</s>I have.</s>
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?</s>He's my son.</s>How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.</s>Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.</s>Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.</s>What's this about, money?</s>It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.</s>
I have to tell you something --</s>We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!</s>It's about Mars --</s>
...Yes?</s>Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...</s>...One second.</s>
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.</s>Bollocks.</s>Well I can.</s>
Always a pleasure, Brucie.</s>Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?</s>Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?</s>Never</s>Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?</s>Just sent 'em through.</s>
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.</s>People notice you Frida.</s>
- you could put 'em on your expense account?</s>In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...</s>Bullshit! Bullshit!</s>
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!</s>Move out of the way!</s>
Can I get my life back?</s>Maybe.</s>
It's gorgeous!</s>Am I really gonna have my own room?</s>
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.</s>Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.</s>Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.</s>When can I see you again?</s>You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?</s>
What the hell are we arguing about?</s>I don't know...You...I don't know.</s>
You okay?</s>I wanna leave. Get me out of here.</s>Oh, come on. It's early.</s>Where are we?</s>We're at Della's.</s>Where?</s>What do you mean? Where do you think?</s>Where's Della? Bring her here?</s>Why? What for?</s>Show me Della!</s>Hey, I'm here.</s>
You're going to steal the leads?</s>Have I said that?</s>
How many families we talking about here?</s>Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.</s>You think there's more?</s>Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.</s>
What's up with that?</s>Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?</s>Thanks, Sidra.</s>Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.</s>

Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!</s>That's the boardwalk, Sam.</s>Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.</s>
How'd you get in here?</s>I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.</s>You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.</s>Did you miss me?</s>No.</s>Come over here and tell me no.</s>

Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?</s>Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...</s>You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?</s>No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.</s>I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.</s>I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.</s>Do you think Darryl's having an affair?</s>I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.</s>But you think he fools around.</s>Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.

I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.</s>Gordon Liddy, you mean?</s>It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.</s>Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.</s>

That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!</s>Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?</s>

Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.

Have a shot?</s>What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?</s>That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.</s>
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!</s>Looks good, Mom!</s>

There is no exit visa for him.</s>Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?</s>Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.</s>

And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?</s>They're...</s>

I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.</s>Like you protected Landry?</s>I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.</s>
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."</s>The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.</s>

I'm hungry.</s>Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!</s>Can I have my supper please?</s>Naturally.</s>Can I have milk too?</s>Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.</s>

Some kind of private beef between the two of you?</s>Look, I didn't shoot him!</s>We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?</s>Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.</s>Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.</s>Colonel, don't you know what's going on?</s>Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.</s>Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.</s>You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!</s>Didn't they tell you?</s>They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.</s>Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?</s>
We will, sir!</s>From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?</s>
How much could you grow? Realistically.</s>As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.</s>Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.</s>You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.</s>
I don't really remember that.</s>Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....</s>Yes, yes, right.</s>
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.</s>Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?</s>Why not tell me now?</s>
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.</s>Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.</s>Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...</s>
I bought it at a store in L.A.</s>Who made it?</s>I don't know.</s>What do you mean?</s>
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --</s>Hey, Tattoo!</s>-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.</s>

We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.</s>Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?</s>I don't know.  He took it hard.</s>All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.</s>
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.</s>Because he likes you.</s>Me?</s>Yeah.</s>
What's in Memphis?</s>Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.</s>
What the fuck did you do that for?</s>If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!</s>What're you talking about?</s>You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!</s>It was only a few times...</s>And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!</s>A couple...?</s>I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!</s>Would you let me explain...</s>Explain what?

They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.</s>Then the roads are open...</s>The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.</s>The phones are working?</s>Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.

Man, that one made me puke!</s>You forgot something...</s>Are we leaving?</s>Yes you are.</s>
How about we go somewhere else?</s>Want to see my raft?</s>
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.</s>They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?</s>That's exactly what I am.</s>
Don't get your hopes up.</s>Come on, where's your enthusiasm?</s>

I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.</s>Well, I honestly feel that way.

How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!</s>I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.</s>

Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.</s>

I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?</s>Yeah.</s>Is that all you have to say?</s>What am I supposed to say?</s>Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.</s>
What can I do for you, lad?</s>I was hoping we could talk.</s>Talk?  About what?</s>About things.  About your wife.</s>Sweet Grace?  What about her?</s>About what you said this morning.</s>

Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...</s>So how would you put it?</s>Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...</s>Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!</s>Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?

First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.</s>But he was called...</s>Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.</s>

What, honey?</s>I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --</s>I know you do, darling.</s>And you could care less --</s>Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.</s>Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?</s>
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.</s>And Bobbie says...</s>Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.</s>Yes.</s>

Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --</s>Tachlinkov.</s>Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.

Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?</s>Uh-huh.</s>That's funny. Why is that?</s>Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]</s>
Here it is.</s>There it is...now what about the others?</s>
And mine's Conway.</s>How do you do?</s>You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction—</s>
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.</s>This came for you, sweetie.</s>Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!</s>
What?</s>I... I brought you something.</s>A cigarette?</s>An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.</s>
You going to sit here all day?</s>I don't know. I haven't decided yet.</s>Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.</s>It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.</s>Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.</s>I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?</s>I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?</s>Just passing through.</s>Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.</s>I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.</s>It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.</s>It'll cost you five bucks.</s>Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?</s>Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.</s>Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?</s>I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.</s>Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?</s>Not a one.</s>Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.</s>It was just a thought.</s>Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.</s>
There were a lot of variables to consider --</s>No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.</s>
What do you mean?</s>It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.</s>
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.</s>What's the charge?</s>
What in the...?</s>Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.</s>We've got to get the nanobot.</s>It's too late.  Argon injected it.</s>You mean he's polymerized, like me?</s>

Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.</s>God....damn you, Rhodes!</s>God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?</s>You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!</s>No wonder they're so....hungry.</s>
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.</s>Uh-huh.</s>Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.</s>Uh-huh.</s>They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?</s>
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.</s>That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.</s>We need padded chairs.</s>Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...</s>
Kelly's next, Gloria.</s>Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.</s>
What's this?</s>The best I could do with what was in your fridge.</s>
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.</s>Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.</s>You know where I live?</s>We're both professionals, Oatman.</s>I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.</s>So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?</s>Yes.</s>Mmm.</s>
I don't know how to thank you.</s>I enjoyed every minute of it.</s>
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.</s>I'll take my chances.</s>
I suppose not.</s>I prefer the floor.</s>
No!</s>Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.</s>
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!</s>Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.</s>
One of your cases?</s>Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.</s>
No, I won't let you do it.</s>Alex, what are you doing?</s>Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.</s>
Mr. Green?</s>Yes, ma'am. How are you today?</s>Didn't you get?... How are you?</s>I'm fine. Can I go up?</s>Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.</s>
How are you, you three scoundrels?</s>Well, we're back home.</s>
And my permission?</s>I'd like yours too.</s>
You look awful.</s>Thank you.</s>
You want another drink, honey...?</s>I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.</s>
You know who that is?</s>Yea.</s>I see.</s>
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...</s>They did it... they assimilated Earth.</s>
Hmmm...44 long.</s>I always knew you'd do the job.</s>
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?</s>Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!</s>
Sorry about last night.</s>Forget it.</s>I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?</s>No.</s>You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.</s>Fear and ignorance.</s>No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!</s>I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.</s>
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.</s>Thanks.</s>We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.</s>I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.</s>You want the job or not?</s>
What'd he say?</s>Who cares?</s>
And what makes you think he's in this territory?</s>Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.</s>
You take the microwave?</s>What am I going to do with a microwave?</s>You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.</s>So you're angry.  Big deal.</s>
Hey.</s>Hey.</s>You got a dog?</s>It's not ours.  It's George's.</s>
So whatja do now?</s>I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.</s>We don't need any misfits around here, son.</s>
...  I needed that.</s>Tell me about it.</s>
Is he upset?</s>He didn't say anything to me about it.</s>
Oh, Rufus!</s>All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.</s>Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.</s>I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.</s>
Alright. Let's talk business.</s>Why not?</s>
You fool, you fool.</s>Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?</s>
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.</s>But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.</s>To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.</s>
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!</s>Martin, this is kind of an official meeting</s>Perfect.  Look at this ---</s>
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.</s>How am I gonna do that?</s>I don't know, figure something out.</s>
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.</s>You're hurting.</s>You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...</s>
What?  That's horrible!</s>What happened?</s>
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"</s>I never heard that song. But what did they do?</s>Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.</s>
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.</s>Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.</s>
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.</s>De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.</s>He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself...</s>
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.</s>Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.</s>Just what the hell is wrong with you?</s>
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...</s>Oh no?</s>Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.</s>
Really?</s>Really.</s>
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?</s>Yes.  For a whole year.</s>I thought you said three years.</s>
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?</s>By the Creator.</s>To join, and become One with the Creator?</s>To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.</s>
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.</s>-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.</s>I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?</s>It's only a half-hour show, Rod.</s>
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.</s>Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?</s>
Simon just ejected!</s>Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.</s>You mean...</s>That's right -- premature ejection.</s>What will happen to him, Ted?</s>The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.</s>
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.</s>It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.</s>After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.</s>
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.</s>He's already been.</s>
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.</s>Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.</s>

But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.</s>What'd you expect to hear?</s>Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember?

You're a Sal Mineo Indian.</s>
Maybe that is his boat.</s>Gimme a break.</s>
How did you get this number?</s>Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?</s>I'm on my way.</s>
You can't kill me yet.</s>Why?</s>I could be lying.</s>
Wow!  What was that all about?</s>It's just somebody's idea of a joke...</s>That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?</s>Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.</s>Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!</s>How can you be so sure?</s>Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!</s>

Just say how you knew...</s>Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.</s>

Where's Roach?</s>Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?</s>You gotta tell me where she is.</s>And let my policy expire?  Sorry.</s>Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.</s>I say when it's over!</s>The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar.

Where's Mom?</s>She's gone to Moundsville.</s>To see Dad?</s>Yes, I reckon that's it.</s>
No. Thank you.</s>Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?</s>Only if you grab my ass.</s>
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.</s>Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.</s>
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.</s>Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?</s>Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.</s>But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --</s>We can light our own tree at home.</s>

He thinks this is some kind of game!</s>I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.</s>
Get me into a plane!</s>Come on!</s>
Truck.</s>Truck.  Of course.</s>'63 Chevy.</s>I knew it.</s>So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?</s>I don't, really.  I was referred to him.</s>Oh, really.</s>
What have you done?</s>What have I done?! Idiots.</s>
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.</s>As you did at Fort Wilderness?</s>
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!</s>Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?</s>I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?</s>All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?</s>When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?</s>Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--</s>
Mom expects great things from you ...</s>Harold ... can I get you anything?</s>
Go fuck yourself...</s>Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!</s>
You came through, Nicky.</s>I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.</s>You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.</s>What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?</s>Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.</s>
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.</s>Whiskey?</s>The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.</s>I'll be over.</s>Bring back your policemen...</s>
What about the brakes?</s>Fine. Nowt wrong with them.</s>How'd it happen, then?</s>He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.</s>Was he?</s>
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.</s>Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.</s>For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.</s>For the flat.</s>No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.</s>She hated you --</s>Well, she had problems --</s>-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.</s>-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?</s>
Can I help you?</s>I'm... just looking for Parry...</s>He's not here.</s>
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.</s>I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.</s>All of them?</s>That's right. We work well together.</s>Major Burns is far from satisfied.</s>That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.</s>On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.</s>And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.</s>I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'</s>It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...</s>That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.</s>Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.</s>I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.</s>Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.</s>
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?</s>No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.</s>
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?</s>Most of the time.</s>But not now?</s>Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.</s>You need a vacation.</s>Just had one.</s>Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...</s>When was the last time you took one?</s>Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.</s>How often you go?</s>Dozen times a day.</s>
Look.  Water.</s>Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?</s>
Miss me, Dave?</s>Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.</s>
Isn't it enough that I can love you?</s>Mmm...</s>Hmm?</s>...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.</s>
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?</s>Yeah, it still runs.</s>Do me a favor buddy, please.</s>What is it?</s>
Why?</s>Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.</s>Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?</s>Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.</s>Why?</s>
You will??</s>For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.</s>
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.</s>There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.</s>Am I that close to Fairvale?</s>Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.</s>
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.</s>And, what a delightful idea!</s>Ah -- you approve?</s>I think it's absolutely charming.</s>I'm glad you like it.</s>Whatever suggested the idea to you?</s>I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.</s>
It killed her.  It ate her.</s>Shh.  Shhh....</s>
What's this?</s>That's my diet shit.</s>
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -</s>I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -</s>

Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!</s>Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.</s>I know damn well she's there.</s>
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.</s>Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?</s>Thanks are hardly necessary.</s>Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.</s>I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.</s>It ain't for lack of trying.</s>So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?</s>Why, Doctor! We've only just met!</s>
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.</s>Not a dent.

What are you doing?</s>I was looking for you.</s>
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.</s>I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?</s>Michael, yes, we was all relieved...</s>In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.</s>
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.</s>Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!</s>
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.</s>I'll try and make it.</s>Looking forward!</s>
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.</s>Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?</s>Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.</s>
What movies?</s>Ask me what I don't have.</s>
What now?</s>We walk.</s>
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...</s>Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...</s>
Oh Janet</s>For you.</s>
You've been staying in a motel all this time?</s>For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...</s>I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.</s>Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...</s>Oh, no. You're more than welcome.</s>Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.</s>Not at all.</s>
What is your first name?</s>What?</s>It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.</s>
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.</s>That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.</s>
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!</s>The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?</s>
Does he know you know?</s>He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.</s>Why?!</s>She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.</s>Please don't go.</s>At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.</s>
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?</s>Shut up and drink.</s>
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?</s>Nah...</s>Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.</s>

Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...</s>I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?</s>Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.</s>
Is he there?</s>No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.</s>Absolutely.  Right.</s>
Well ...</s>When I tell you to stay put, stay put.</s>
What does it say?</s>It's gone to the top.</s>How high is that?</s>The numbers stop at 107.</s>
Direct hit -</s>Confirmed, Captain!</s>
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --</s>Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?</s>This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.</s>Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?</s>Somebody named Leo Crow.</s>And who the hell is that?</s>I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.</s>All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...</s>I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!</s>Then come to my house.  We'll talk --</s>I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.</s>How could Witwer have accessed the case file?</s>Can you fake the cerebral output?</s>We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.</s>You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...

Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?</s>Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.</s>

Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.</s>I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.</s>
Detective Niccoletti?</s>What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?</s>
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?</s>Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.</s>Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.</s>I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.</s>What?</s>It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.</s>
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.</s>And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.</s>You don't believe in the paranormal.</s>No, but she does, and that's all that matters.</s>Does she know that's why you're using her?</s>No.</s>I, I just can't...</s>She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.</s>I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.</s>This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.</s>
This is the suitcase you gave me.</s>I gave you?</s>I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.</s>

I'm sorry that didn't work out.</s>It's fine.</s>You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.</s>He did seem a little strange.</s>Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.</s>I'm sorry.

Peerless, your father called.</s>I'll be right over.</s>

Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --</s>Then you remember more than I do.</s>
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.</s>I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?</s>Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.</s>Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?</s>I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.</s>Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.</s>Proceed.</s>If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.</s>
Alors?</s>Alors quoi?</s>Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?</s>A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.</s>But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.</s>Then why don’t you reach him?</s>I don’t have your credentials, Nathalie.</s>
Father...</s>It's already over.</s>
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.</s>Then why?</s>Because he is not afraid of me.</s>
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?</s>I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.</s>Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?</s>

You designed Gotham Plaza?

You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?</s>I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?</s>You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..</s>

Jake, this is your father's bedroom.</s>That's all right. He don't mind.</s>
Are you kidding?</s>No.</s>Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?</s>Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.</s>
And all your friends, there's a good lad.</s>There is only three of us here.</s>Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?</s>I mean it, there is only three of us here.</s>Plank?</s>

Things are kind of confusing.</s>I'll back that up.</s>Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.</s>I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.</s>It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.</s>No, you're not.</s>
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.</s>What can I do about it?</s>You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.</s>Nobody's as evil as my brothers.

Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?</s>
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?</s>No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.</s>Why not?</s>Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.</s>What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?</s>Yes, sir.</s>Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me.

We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --</s>She held that against you?</s>Apparently she was very disappointed.</s>Boy. Boy, oh boy.</s>

Pretty girl.</s>If you like 'em like that.</s>You got types?</s>Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.</s>Who is she?</s>I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.</s>By the way, how is your father's side?</s>Much better, thanks.</s>How many drinks have you had?</s>Six Martinis.</s>Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.</s>
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.</s>Not this one.  This one's on me.</s>
I'm sorry.</s>Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?</s>

It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.</s>Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.</s>
Bad luck to see death in the snow.</s>But what happened to the little deer?</s>Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.</s>Why is it just lying there?

It's not a bank.</s>It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.</s>

What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.</s>Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.</s>For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.</s>Feeling old?</s>
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?</s>I don't understand.</s>
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?</s>She'll say, "Now my son is a man."</s>It's so dirty.</s>Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.</s>
Your dancing's very good.</s>Thanks.</s>It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.</s>Guess I must've learned.</s>

You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?</s>Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.</s>
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.</s>First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.</s>
...again.</s>There isn't enough for two laughs.</s>

What little I'm sure he has.</s>You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.</s>Yes.</s>Through the forehead?</s>Yes.</s>Wrong!

I knew you had it all under control.</s>Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?</s>Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.</s>On one condition...</s>

You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.</s>The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!</s>
Happy birthday Adele.</s>Early, you are so sweet.</s>
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.</s>He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.</s>Maybe he's just - waiting...</s>If we married, we'd shut him out forever.</s>
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?</s>No.</s>
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.</s>Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.</s>
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.</s>Who wrote this book?</s>
Excuse me -</s>Yes?</s>Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?</s>Your friend?</s>He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.</s>Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.</s>No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.</s>Well then - yes.  Of course.</s>Thank you.  Thank you.</s>
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??</s>I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!</s>
Go on, Doctor.</s>No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.</s>It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.</s>I can get it.</s>
At least I let you tag along.</s>Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.</s>Knock it off. You're not mad.</s>No?</s>No. You like the way I do things.</s>It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.</s>
How does he look up close?</s>Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-</s>A bad attitude.</s>Yeah, he got a bad attitude.</s>You said before, that he got boxes?</s>
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!</s>I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?</s>
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?</s>One moment, sir.</s>
What?</s>This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?</s>Now wait just a fucking-</s>Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.</s>
What should I do?</s>Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.</s>God ... this can't be true.</s>Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.</s>
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.</s>Wow. I'm glad I met you.</s>
Wuddya mean, buddy?</s>Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!</s>
It's been a while.</s>This was my very first slow dance.</s>
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.</s>A likely story. Hand it over, kid.</s>No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.</s>
Who? Me?</s>Who do you think!</s>
Control tower, reading, Sir.</s>Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.</s>
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.</s>Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --</s>
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.</s>Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.</s>Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?</s>It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.</s>You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.</s>I don't know.</s>Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-</s>Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.</s>Okay, okay. Okay.</s>That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-</s>Yeah.</s>
I see the Prince of Wales is here.</s>I hope he got his mother's permission.</s>
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.</s>Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.</s>Who the devil is he?</s>A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.</s>
Hey, Mike?</s>What? Are you all right?</s>I think we're making a lot of noise.</s>I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</s>
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.</s>It's not my style, okay?</s>Nice guys finish last. I should know.</s>
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.</s>Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.</s>
What?</s>Zuzu's petals.</s>
I didn't use you, Max.</s>I didn't say you did.</s>I never lied to you.</s>I know.</s>We're partners.</s>I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.</s>Do you blame yourself for helping me?</s>
I love you.</s>I love you too, Dad.</s>
What do you think are you're up to?</s>Someone put it on me.</s>
So what are you doing here?</s>He wants to know who brought in the chalice.</s>That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.</s>
I think she's lying.</s>Me, too.</s>We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.</s>Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --</s>Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.</s>Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?</s>This is different.</s>Why?</s>To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.</s>I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --</s>Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?</s>We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.</s>
What is this!?</s>God, wake up, it's a con!</s>
Did I scowl at you?</s>No, you smiled.</s>I don't remember.</s>I know, I kind of blend in here.</s>
I think I may just go on to the reservation.</s>Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...</s>
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.</s>You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.</s>
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...</s>That's when you went to the Orphanage...</s>
You really think he wanted to kill you?</s>All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.</s>
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.</s>Finish what?</s>He knows. He knows!</s>
For Pete's sake, Norville!</s>Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --</s>Never mind about that...</s>
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...</s>I'll be fine, Dad.</s>
Just one minute...</s>You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.</s>
Hello.</s>Hello.</s>
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?</s>Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--</s>She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?</s>That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.</s>Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?</s>Where?  What do you mean, where?</s>Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--</s>--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.</s>
What's that tune that you're playing</s>Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.</s>How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.</s>
Dead.  Damnit!</s>Where's the professor?</s>
Would you care to go topside?</s>Very much.</s>
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?</s>Willie Mays.</s>
Hi, Mickey...</s>What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?</s>Uh...</s>Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...</s>...now who is that...?</s>...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...</s>Sally Doneghy, now who is that?</s>One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...</s>...hey, I don't need your charity...</s>...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.</s>
You were the one who was dying.</s>Yes...</s>
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...</s>Who cares ?</s>You're right. Let's never stop...</s>
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?</s>Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.</s>
<u>Yeah</u>!</s>Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.</s>Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.</s>
John!</s>Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?</s>
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?</s>Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.</s>
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.</s>You trust his character more than anyone else does.</s>Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.</s>Save my son, d'Artagnan.</s>
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.</s>I'd love to go there one time...</s>You and Frank ever take a vacation?</s>Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.</s>
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?</s>Yes, sir--</s>
You take one more step, I'll kill her.</s>You'd do her a favor.</s>
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?</s>"Do chickens give milk?"</s>Exactly.</s>
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!</s>What's the problem here?</s>
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!</s>What was that all about?</s>
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...</s>I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.</s>...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.</s>
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.</s>Tradin' your skins in Castleton?</s>
I think I'm falling asleep.</s>Pleasant dreams.</s>
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.</s>You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.</s>If you get it back in one piece.</s>It's a risk I'm willing to take.</s>
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?</s>No. I'm all alone.</s>Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.</s>That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.</s>
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--</s>Yech...</s>
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?</s>It's perfect.</s>
What was that??</s>Hostage negotiations.</s>
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.</s>Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...</s>
Saturn. Beautiful.</s>Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --</s>But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --</s>Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.</s>Or building blocks for a world that never formed.</s>
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!</s>I don't want Caitlin...</s>You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?</s>I don't want to go back with her...</s>Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.</s>Randal...?</s>And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.</s>Veronica, I love you...</s>Fuck you.</s>
What the fuck are we going to do?</s>Hide him.</s>
It's okay. I want the rush.</s>No. Look.</s>
That is a picture, nothing more.</s>You mean we are not children of Satan?</s>No.</s>
Impossible.</s>I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.</s>
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.</s>May we have this wolf's name and address?</s>These guys have no place.  They change virtually everyday. And his name...  It's a surname.</s>
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?</s>He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.</s>Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.</s>
Hi.</s>Hi.</s>What's up?</s>Just watching you.</s>I got that.  How was your day?</s>
Was he a good man?</s>Yup.</s>Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.</s>
Those assholes.</s>The poor girl's out of a job.</s>Yeah...  I should give her a call.</s>

Welcome back, Night Owl.</s>What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?</s>
Where... where am I?</s>Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.</s>Reed?... Sue?</s>They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.</s>
Aw come on, Miss Price!</s>Call me Alex.</s>Aw come on, Alex!</s>Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?</s>
What do you do when you come here?</s>I sit. I think. I play games.</s>What kind of games?</s>I like to play "reality".</s>
I don't get it.</s>It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.</s>
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.</s>I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.</s>
Breakfast.</s>Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.</s>
What?</s>What do you mean, "what?"</s>What are you snickering about?</s>I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.</s>What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?</s>
Ready?</s>Ready.</s>
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!</s>I'd use pills. They're painless.</s>Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?</s>
Is that all?</s>Just remember, I'll be watching.</s>
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.</s>Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.</s>
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.</s>Are all of you named Jones?</s>Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.</s>

It is on.</s>...it is so on.</s>
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.</s>Should I...</s>Just a two-second dissolve.</s>
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.</s>Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.</s>
Intravenous administration complete.</s>Initiating connection.</s>
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.</s>Evidence of what?</s>Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.</s>
Stop him, Clark!</s>He may have a gun!</s>Oh, for God's sake!</s>
That's a thousand million electron volts.</s>I knew that.</s>
Hey, you wanna bet?</s>I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.</s>If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...</s>Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.</s>That's never been one of my problems.</s>
OW!</s>I'm going to leave now.</s>You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!</s>
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.</s>So? Be real easy.</s>Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.</s>Anyone?</s>
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.</s>I am a tourist.</s>
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.</s>You've not aged a day since then?</s>Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.</s>
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.</s>I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.</s>He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -</s>Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.</s>Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.</s>
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.</s>I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?</s>Productive. So they're closing down the school?</s>Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.</s>
David, what are you doing?</s>Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.</s>David, stop!</s>
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.</s>It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.</s>The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.</s>Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.</s>
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.</s>He was a unique individual.</s>
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --</s>-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.</s>But Richard, no, I, I --</s>-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?</s>
Somebody broke in.</s>Now who'd go and do...</s>
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.</s>I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.</s>The present situation?</s>I mean the reasons for my coming here.</s>We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?</s>I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.</s>Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--</s>This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.</s>I -- I'm not sure I understand--</s>I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.</s>I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.</s>I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?</s>You know about the United Nations?</s>We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.</s>You must have a rather strange impression of us.</s>The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.</s>

Laura, you didn't come and see me today.</s>I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.</s>A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.</s>I'm not.</s>Did you make me a tape?</s>I already made you two tapes.</s>Laura, you have to deal with all of this.</s>I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.</s>Send me a kiss.</s>

Of course not!</s>If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.</s>
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.</s>A what?</s>Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.</s>Silence?  No talking?  All day?</s>Until sundown.</s>
Okay, lady. Out.</s>Hello.</s>
Goodnight, Spock.</s>Goodnight, Doctor.</s>
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.</s>For what?</s>You saved my life.</s><u>Heart attacks happen</u>.</s>
Who are you talking to?</s>He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...</s>
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!</s>Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.</s>I can't, it's yours.</s>Take it. damn it!</s>Okay.</s>

Braddock -- Braddock?</s>Yes, but I'm afraid --</s>I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.</s>No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.</s>I'm afraid I don't understand.</s>I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.</s>Hey -- I don't get it.</s>

From where?  D.C.?</s>Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.</s>
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.</s>Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.</s>
Grubbel's here. See?</s>Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.</s>Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.</s>
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --</s>Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.</s>A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --</s>Stop that, Fran.</s>You'll miss your train, Jeff.</s>
Oh.</s>BLACK BACKGROUND.</s>
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.</s>I met one of them.</s>
Will he live?</s>I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.</s>
The money, the gear!</s>That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.</s>OK, don't panic; let's think about this.</s>
So he has no idea what's about to happen?</s>No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.</s>What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.</s>Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.</s>
I buy that.</s>As in, the vegetable?</s>
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.</s>Good. Then I'll meet you there.</s>
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --</s>I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.</s>
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?</s>I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.</s>I know you do.</s>
Now what?</s>Jump!</s>
Your new car.</s>- Four wheel drive?</s>Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.</s>... 17 Beverage cup holders?</s>Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.</s>
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.</s>You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?</s>
But, last night...</s>Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?</s>I'm sorry.</s>And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.</s>
That you, Talley?</s>The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.</s>You oughta try on the problem I got in here.</s>I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.</s>
No.</s>Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.</s>
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.</s>And our troops here?</s>We've been collecting planes from all over but...</s>But what, General?</s>Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.</s>Then find them.</s>
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.</s>You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.</s>That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.</s>Winston Churchill.</s>
What is he doing in here?</s>Relax, Burn, he's my guest.</s>
I don't care for him.</s>He's your brother.</s>So?</s>
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?</s>Anything it samples by physical contact.</s>
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?</s>Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --</s>LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?</s>No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...</s>C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --</s>We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.</s>BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT, DAD WE NEED TO GET HIS MONEY AND GO.</s>
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.</s>Damn. Your dad did this?</s>
Yeah, right...</s>Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.</s>And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.</s>
Aren't you going to get that?</s>Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...</s>
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.</s>She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.</s>I trust you.</s>Oh Soph...</s>You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.</s>And the food sucks, I know.</s>You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.</s>Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!</s>Well good.  Thank God.</s>Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.</s>Oh honey, let's.</s>
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.</s>No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.</s>Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.</s>
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.</s>Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?</s>
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.</s>Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.</s>
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?</s>I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!</s>What?  Jesus, tell me!</s>It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!</s>
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.</s>Good idea.</s>I'll be Elvis and you--</s>
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.</s>So where are you now?</s>Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.</s>Shit.</s>Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.</s>
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?</s>His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."</s>His what??!!</s>

You're upset, huh?</s>Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.</s>You liked the guy, though.</s>Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.</s>We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...</s>
HER!</s>Arrest that woman!</s>
You like my Mordechai, yes?</s>He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.</s>
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.</s>All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.</s>Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.</s>Think nothin' of it.</s>

Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm.

I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.</s>Good luck. It's not there anymore.</s>
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.</s>Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.</s>
I... I .....</s>You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.</s>I wanted to let his family know....</s>Know what ? That it was your fault ?</s>It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...</s>So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.</s>
No shit!</s>Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?</s>
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?</s>She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.</s>Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?</s>Yes.</s>
Are you sure this is a real dance?</s>Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --</s>Really?</s>Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.</s>You're right!</s>You -- you think I'm right?</s>Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!</s>
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?</s>That's what the guy said.</s>Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.</s>
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.</s>Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?</s>From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.</s>
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...</s>How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.</s>
It's not what you think.</s>I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.</s>I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.</s>There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.</s>Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?</s>I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.</s>
Good morning.</s>Well maybe for you.</s>Something wrong?</s>Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.</s>Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.</s>
This was not my idea.</s>What?</s>I said, this...Do you want a drink?</s>
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...</s>-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.</s>They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.</s>
So, where'd you go today.</s>Around.</s>
Wait.</s>Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?</s>Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.</s>
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.</s>Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.</s>
My God... these people are insane.</s>Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.</s>
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??</s>No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.</s>All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?</s>That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.</s>
Hey, it's... been two years --</s>We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.</s>

Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?</s>Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.</s>
Hi, babe.</s>Hi, hon.  How's it going?</s>Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.</s>

You'd like her.</s>Yeah, but please don't do that.</s>I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.</s>Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.</s>It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.</s>Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.</s>That's your fault not mine.</s>I don't think I'm going to the party.</s>So it's ok if I bring her.</s>Please don't.</s>She's really cute and she's really nice.</s>...please, I just don't want it....</s>....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?</s>Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --</s>I'm trying to be your friend.</s>I know.</s>I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.</s>Well, yeah, thank you, but --</s>-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.</s>

Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet.

Is this satisfactory?</s>Thank you, Louis.</s>
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!</s>Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.</s>I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!</s>Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.</s>But you're just like the characters in the stories.</s>Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?</s>You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.</s>So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?</s>You're not married, are you?</s>What do you think?</s>No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.</s>You're probably right.</s>

What did you do today?</s>Um........Stuff.</s>What kind of stuff?</s>Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.</s>
I see your point.</s>So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.</s>
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!</s>What now, Sonny?</s>Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ...</s>
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.</s>Aren't we a little old for that?</s>
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...</s>Mmmm -- so can I...</s>
Yes, well...</s>You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.</s>And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.</s>No, really.</s>You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.</s>
Phileas Fogg?</s>... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.</s>You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?</s>I told you.</s>
Where'd she been?</s>Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.</s>But I guess she told Dieter.</s>
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?</s>Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.</s>Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.</s>All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --</s>Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.</s>
We have to go.</s>No, wait! At least stay for dinner!</s>
Its muscles are locked.</s>Oh, Jesus!!</s>

You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.</s>Have you found Dr. Bright?</s>No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.</s>
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.</s>I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?</s>

Oh, geez, yeah.</s>Okay.</s>
Were we going to get married?</s>Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...</s>
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.</s>Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!</s>Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?</s>
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?</s>--Truman, you're gonna be late!</s>

So, then, you're, like, available?</s>In what way?</s>Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!</s>
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.</s>When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.</s>She is dead — at peace.</s>
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.</s>People don't use that word any more.</s>Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!</s>You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.</s>People now have dignity when frying eggs?</s>They don't have to feel like slaves.</s>Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.</s>
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.</s><u>Liza</u>!</s>You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.</s>You've never seen her run.</s>
I think it's contaminated.</s>You don't even know what that word means.</s>
Turned Czech huh?</s>Yeah, maybe.</s>
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.</s>Starla, it ain't --</s>It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.</s>
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...</s>What's that?</s>A padlock.</s>
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?</s>No.</s>Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.</s>I'll risk it.</s>Why take the risk?</s>To see if I can get away with it.</s>

He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.</s>Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.</s>
Bernie.</s>Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.</s>
Can he really take us home?</s>Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.</s>What about you?</s>If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.</s>
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.</s>Gasparilla?</s>He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.</s>Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?</s>That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.</s>We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.</s>Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.</s>
Debi's house.</s>Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?</s>No. You drove us here.</s>Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?</s>No.</s>

Did you say something?</s>I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.</s>Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.</s>Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.</s>And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.</s>Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.</s>There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.</s>Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.</s>
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.</s>Five thirty.  Okay.</s>Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.</s>Got it.  Good tip.</s>Bye...</s>

What are you doing there?</s>Hiding.</s>I think you're soft or something.</s>
You got the schematics?</s>Everything.</s>
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.</s>I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that?

You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.</s>We know.</s>I'm giving you a chance to walk away.</s>
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.</s>So what's in there -- ?</s>I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight.

Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.</s>If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?</s>It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.</s>
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!</s>Yes, sir.</s>I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!</s>

Holy shit! Look at the size of that!</s>That's your monkey, Denham.</s>Kong ...</s>
You coming in?</s>No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?</s>Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.</s>
Yes, I guess you're right</s>Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?</s>

Guess who I saw today.</s>Who?</s>Doctor David Ravell.</s>What? Where was he?!</s>ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!</s>
When did it start?</s>The first reports came in at about ten.</s>Why didn't you wake me then?</s>At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.</s>How did it spread so quickly?</s>It is the work of incendiaries.</s>I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.</s>Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!</s>Impossible, I don't believe it.</s>We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.</s>But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.</s>From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.</s>My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.</s>
Oh Michael, look...</s>Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...</s>Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?</s>All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.</s>We'll settle it tonight.</s>
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.</s>Where are his pants?</s>Who knows?</s>

I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.</s>
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.</s>We need ice.</s>
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.</s>So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.</s>It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.</s>So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.</s>
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.</s>Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?</s>... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?</s>

What?</s>I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.</s>
Okay?</s>Okay, okay.  I think.</s>
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...</s>What d'ya mean?</s>There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.</s>
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.</s>Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.</s>
Julia.</s>Oh my God.</s>Don't look at me.</s>Who are you?</s>I said: don't look.</s>
So who -- what -- are you?</s>Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...</s>Can you show me?</s>Small moves, Captain, small moves.</s>Why did you contact us?</s>You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.</s>And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?</s>Many others.</s>And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.</s>Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.</s>So who...?</s>We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.</s>The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?</s>Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.</s>So we passed some kind of test?</s>You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...</s>
Michael? What ha...</s>Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...</s>
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.</s>What is that?</s>Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.</s>But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?</s>No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.</s>But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.</s>May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.</s>
Another bridesmaid?</s>Flower girl.</s>
Do you want to take a quick swim?</s>Well...</s>Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!</s>
What's her name, anyway?</s>What do you care?</s>
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.</s>You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.</s>Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.</s>You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.</s>As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.</s>
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.</s>Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.</s>
Anna.</s>Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?</s>Anna Moss.</s>Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?</s>
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...</s>We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!</s>You don't know if he was really gonna --</s>Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.</s>

No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!</s>Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.</s>Don't you believe it.</s>
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.</s>How is it back there?</s>I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend.

Barnes, where the hell have you been?!</s>Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?</s>What did you find out?</s>Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.</s>It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.

Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass?

I've often thought about going back.</s>You have?</s>Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."</s>He sounds like a person worth while knowing.</s>

Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.</s>I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions.

Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...</s>And this makes you "sad"?</s>Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them.

You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!</s>You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!</s>FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!</s>
And good morning.</s>Good morning.</s>Nice spot.</s>It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.</s>
No. We can't.</s>Why not?</s>Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.</s>
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.</s>You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.</s>I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.</s>
Are these all of her previsions?</s>There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...</s>
Okay, lemme walk you through it.</s>Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.</s>
Watch the first step.</s>Surf's up.</s>
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?</s>I am See-Threepio, human-cy...</s>Yes or no will do.</s>Oh. Well, yes.</s>How many languages do you speak?</s>I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...</s>Splendid!

It's freaky.</s>Can I ask you a question?</s>Depends on the question.</s>Are you still in love with Alan?</s>No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.</s>Why'd you let me in?</s>Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.</s>Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?</s>Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.</s>Good point.</s>Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.</s>What about his parents?</s>He never sees them and I never met them.</s>How come?</s>
Are you sure?</s>I told you. I'm like positive.</s>This thing works. We could go home right now.</s>I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.</s>

Anything?</s>Nothing.</s>So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.</s>Someone must've pulled the records.</s>

Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -</s>Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?</s>
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.</s>Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.</s>
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.</s>Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?</s>I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.</s>Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?</s>To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.</s>I see. Helmsman?</s>
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.</s>We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.</s>
Someone you know?</s>Yes.</s>

Okay. Hi.</s>So who's the lucky guy?</s>Who?</s>The groom?</s>

I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?</s>Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.</s>
She's innocent.</s>Aren't they all?</s>Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.</s>
Why did you do that?</s>Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...</s>
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?</s>I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.</s>I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.</s>Why not?</s>Well, first of all, it's entomologist.</s>
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...</s>I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...</s>
That's right.</s>Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.</s>So?</s>This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.</s>
She seems pleasant enough.</s>She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.</s>That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.</s>
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?</s>Yes, sir!</s>
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.</s>It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost.

You plan to drink both those beers?</s>Sorry.</s>
Oh, hi, mom.</s>NOW!</s>
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..</s>It's not apparent.</s>...and sort of...disinterest.</s>Disinterest?</s>As if your mind's not all there.</s>I am sort of scattered.</s>Can I help?</s>You are.</s>Are you alright?</s>
David. Please.</s>This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.</s>
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.</s>What's so stupid about it?</s>That you... you don't even know the guy.</s>Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?</s>Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.</s>I like the way he dresses.</s>What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?</s>"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.</s>Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?</s>Right.</s>Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?</s>Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.</s>Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...</s>
Damn him.</s>What's wrong?</s>Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.</s>
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.</s>I appreciate that.</s>
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.</s>Am I?</s>Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.</s>
You flew all the way h...</s>I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.</s>You're butting in.</s>
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?</s>Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!</s>I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?</s>I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .</s>Old?</s>Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.</s>. . . What?</s>Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.</s>
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?</s>Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...</s>
You want a Dairy Queen?</s>No way. I'm about to blow up.</s>
No, you listen. Get out!</s>Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?</s>You have no right here!</s>
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?</s>Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.</s>You need my help?</s>No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.</s>

I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.</s>No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?</s>No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.</s>
What the hell's his problem?</s>You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?</s>
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.</s>Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.</s>
Why not now?</s>What do you mean?</s>How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.</s>But what about you and the baby? You need me.</s>Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.</s>Yeah, it would be kinda great.</s>It would be fantastic.</s>But Dad'll never go for it.</s>You leave your father to me.</s>
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.</s>Yeah? And why is that?</s>Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.</s>
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.</s>I believed her, Pete.</s>
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.</s>I believe you're right, boss.</s>... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...</s>Sir?</s>The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...</s>
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?

You come here often?</s>Sometimes. When it's convenient.</s>How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?</s>Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.</s>
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.</s>Was the bus on time?</s>
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.</s>My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?</s>It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.</s>Us.  You mean the Watchmen.</s>
They'll know who I am.</s>We'll change your appearance.</s>
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...</s>Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?</s>Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.</s>Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.</s>I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.</s>Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...</s>
Now what kind of a crack is that?</s>No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.</s>
Well, are we still on for tonight?</s>I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.</s>Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.</s>All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.</s>

That lady is back, sir.</s>Show her in. Then go to bed.</s>
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.</s>When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.</s>You know my plan of action.</s>To do nothing.</s>That's right.</s>Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...</s>He's asking everybody questions.</s>But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.</s>He's just rattling your cage.</s>Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.</s>We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.</s>
You sure this is where it was?</s>Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.</s>
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?</s>27156789/074328/K.</s>
Yes, mom?</s>This is Mr. Creasy.</s>
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.</s>Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.</s>
In Jerry's safety deposit box.</s>I don't understand.</s>
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?</s>It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.</s>Huh.</s>
So, you were a geek. Big deal.</s>Anita, remember espadrilles?</s>Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.</s>The girls threw them at me in the locker room.</s>Okay. That's bad.</s>At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.</s>Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.</s>
Call the Homicide Squad!</s>How's every little thing?</s>Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?</s>I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!</s>No kiddin'.</s>I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.</s>I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?</s>Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.</s>Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!</s>No foolin' -- any suspect?</s>Do you know George Winton?</s>Old Howard Winton's cub?</s>That's the one.</s>They don't suspect <I>him</I>?</s>Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.</s>Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...</s>Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.</s>What does that prove?</s>Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.</s>Hotcha! Saved, one job!</s>
How far from here?</s>I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.</s>How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.</s>I am afraid this is not the worst news.</s>
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.</s>I'm a little worried --</s>I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.</s>
John . . .?</s>Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.</s>

So have I.  ... Hello?</s>I'm still here.</s>Well, then, talk to me some more.</s>... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.</s>Then, tell me a story.</s>Uh... Ah!  A story?</s>
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.</s>You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.</s>Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?</s>
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?</s>Which one, the big tab or the little tab?</s>Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.</s>Yeah, so things'll be even.</s>
Why are you crying?</s>I'm afraid.</s>Don't invent stories; go to bed.</s>A black bull came.</s>A black bull!</s>

I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.</s>I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.</s>Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?</s>York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.</s>That is not possible.</s>
Three cents.</s>Two cents.</s>

He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!</s>I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.</s>
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?</s>Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?</s>
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?</s>You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --</s>No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history.

Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.</s>Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.</s>Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...</s>She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.</s>

No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.</s>Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?</s>Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.</s>
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --</s>-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.</s>
You don't know?</s>It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.</s>But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.</s>Yes.</s>Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.</s>
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?</s>Spite.</s>They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.</s>
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?</s>Charlie -</s>Yes?</s>It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -</s>You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.</s>
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?</s>Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.</s>I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.</s>You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.</s>I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.</s>
You okay?</s>Keep it down, man.  I got problems.</s>
Are you all right, Dad?</s>Sure ... fine.</s>
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.</s>See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.</s>
What's up?</s>That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.</s>You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.</s>Lead on.</s>
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?</s>Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?</s>Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?</s>Is she?</s>Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!</s>And you honestly think that's what she meant?</s>Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.</s>
Okay.  It's West.</s>The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...</s>
Hi...</s>If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...</s>Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. It’s all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what we’ve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make ‘em sit up and listen.</s>
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.</s>Okay, honey, I'll see you later.</s>
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.</s>Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.</s>She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.</s>I sure turned into an interesting driveway.</s>You did, sir.

Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.</s>Fit the profile?</s>No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.</s>
Bon soir, mademoiselle!</s>Are you French?</s>No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.</s>Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.</s>
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.</s>I'll take them both.</s>
I'm John McClane.</s>Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.</s>
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.</s>Neither are we.</s>
You cold?</s>Freezing.</s>Come here.</s>
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.</s>'Mean the whispers?</s>What whispers?</s>The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.</s>
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.</s>That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.</s>
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?</s>Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.</s>
Will that stop the tear?</s>You got me, Commander.</s>That's your expert opinion?</s>Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.</s>
Yes I am.</s>Are you willing to follow all His commandments?</s>Yes...</s>... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?</s>
It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --</s>The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——</s>Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience</s>Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.</s>
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?</s>Okay.</s>I've left those pills for you.</s>A doper werewolf.</s>
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.</s>Well...</s>...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.</s>Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.</s>She's there with you?  She's there with you?</s>Yeah, she's here.</s>I'll be right there.</s>
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...</s>It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.</s>
Is that Sam Lombardo?</s>Hi, Mon.</s>Sam!  Hi!</s>
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.</s>What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.</s>But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?</s>I'm not anxious to find out, either.</s>Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.</s>Do it.</s>Unfortunately.  We can't.</s>
Mr Brown.</s>Ma'am.</s>You are here safely.</s>Aye, ma'am.</s>You are well?</s>I am.</s>And the pony?</s>She's well, too.</s>
To win?</s>What else?</s>
Your parents would want you to be in bed.</s>You tell stories?</s>Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...</s>
Inigo.</s>What?</s>I hope we win...</s>
Tir Asleen.</s>There's nobody here.</s>
I shouldn't have left her.</s>Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.</s>
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.</s>Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.</s>
Rennie...??</s>The window...</s>
On what? Another job?</s>We get the Mask I'll tell you.</s>A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.</s>Without the Mask it doesn't matter.</s>So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.</s>Let's just see how we do.</s>
Yes. Go away.</s>Let me help you up.</s>
That was too close.</s>Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.</s>
Hello, Dwight.</s>Miss Weathers.</s>I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...</s>I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.</s>
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.</s>It'll get here, soldier.</s>
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.</s>So I heard.</s>Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?</s>Just myself.</s>That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?</s>
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.</s>He didn't either.</s>
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.</s>I didn't have the heart.</s>Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.</s>
I just came here to talk.</s>Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?</s>
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?</s>I have done nothing against the ordnung.</s>Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?</s>I have committed no sin.</s>No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!</s>That is idle talk.</s>Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!</s>
Dolores, wait!</s>Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.</s>Did you really mean those things you said..?</s>
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?</s>Five years ago.  November.</s>Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?</s>Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.</s>Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.</s>She asked for it.</s>I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:</s>
What was that?</s>I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.</s>
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?</s>They're coming in now.</s>How long will it take to receive them all?</s>I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.</s>
You the Captain?</s>Yes.</s>How do we get out of here?</s>We have to make it to the third deck...</s>
What's happening to us?</s>It's all right.</s>Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.</s>I love you.</s>Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.</s>
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.</s>Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.</s>Thank you, Captain.</s>Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?</s>
He's with us...</s>He's with us... He's with us...</s>
I'm sorry?</s>For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?</s>Uh -- both?</s>Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.</s>
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!</s>Dwayne listen to me -</s>Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?</s>I don't know what you're -</s>Don't lie to me!!!!</s>
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?</s>Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.</s>Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.</s>Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.</s>Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.</s>
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.</s>You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.</s>My ticket?</s>I found it on the seat.</s>Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.</s>
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.</s>Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:</s>
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.</s>Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.</s>Should we alert the Sith Lords?</s>I'll make a report later.</s>As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.</s>Send one squad up.</s>
Okay.  Great line at the end.</s>Did you shoot their boots?</s>Of course.</s>We can cut back at the end.</s>To the pan of the supplies boxes --</s>Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.</s>
What is your name?</s>That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.</s>Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.</s>Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!</s>Shut up!</s>OK. Say what it is.</s>The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.</s>
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!</s>More!  More!</s>
What for?</s>We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.</s>Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.</s>C-A-M-E-M...?</s>B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.</s>Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.</s>
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?</s>Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!</s>Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .</s>Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...</s>
Can I help you?</s>Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.</s>Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.</s>So you're not gonna make the movie?</s>No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.</s>
More cultural than political.</s>Obviously.</s>Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....</s>
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...</s>Don't say it.  Orange juice?</s>Please.</s>
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?</s>I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.</s>

We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.</s>I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.</s>Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.</s>Oh.</s>There's a whole wing in this house.</s>Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.</s>You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?</s>I don't know. I don't know.</s>
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.</s>Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?</s>That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.</s>
About what?</s>About us.</s>Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.</s>
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?</s>Wanda...</s>Oh yeah?</s>You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.</s>Yeah?...</s>She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.</s>I'm busy, man.</s>If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!</s>Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!</s>
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?</s>It's what we were warned about.</s>
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.</s>Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.</s>
Oh, no.</s>What?</s>Uh, oh. Now it's time.</s>Honey?</s>
Your brother was a good man.</s>Yeah.</s>Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.</s>Like it never happened...</s>

The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.</s>And we're very grateful.</s>Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.

It's just the 9th.</s>You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?</s>That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all.

I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.</s>Why do you have Dickie's rings?</s>

I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.</s>All right then.</s>Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?</s>Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.</s>Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.</s>Hit was right thoughty of her.</s>I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.</s>All right then.</s>You know that girl I told you about.

I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.</s>If you want me to.</s>I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.</s>I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.</s>I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?</s>They ort to. You're a good boy.</s>Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.</s>Naw.</s>And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.</s>That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?</s>What do you mean?</s>Pull on your works. Your privates.</s>Oh, jackin' off?</s>Yes sir. You ort not know that language.</s>I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?</s>You ort not to pull on yourself that away.</s>I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.</s>He ain't no count.</s>You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.</s>I don't reckon I know.</s>And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?</s>Naw.</s>'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?</s>I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.</s>Why not? It died?</s>Yeah.</s>Why?</s>Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.</s>So it died when it come out?</s>My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.</s>It was alive?</s>Yes sir. Right then it was.</s>A boy or girl?</s>A little ol' boy.</s>You threw it in a trash barrel?</s>I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.</s>It was still alive when you buried it?</s>I heared it cryin' a little through that box.</s>That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.</s>I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.</s>That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.</s>Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.</s>I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?</s>I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.</s>Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.</s>Yes sir, I reckon it does.</s>

Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.</s>Yeah, a little runoff.

I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...</s>Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.</s>That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?</s>No, just you and Paulie.</s>

The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip.  I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard.  That smelled like rust and decay.  It was safe in the boxes.  It was when they took me out --</s>
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!</s>Nineteen!</s>Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.</s>That's too bad.</s>What do you mean, too bad?</s>Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.</s>Well, what are you talking about?

We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.</s>I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.</s>
No, Bud, no... not you.</s>Who then?</s>
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!</s>You Career girls have no idea what we go through.</s>Did you just say "girls?"</s>
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?</s>That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...</s>
Oh, no!</s>Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!</s>
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?</s>What...?</s>Is this a bad time.</s>We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...</s>What happened...?</s>They, uh, they got to my witness.</s>...and is that serious?</s>

I'll do it.</s>That's not what I mean.</s>Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.</s>

I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.</s>Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?</s>Right.</s>
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.</s>Hi, Lenny.</s>
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.</s>Thanks.</s>Call your mother.  You never call her.</s>
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?</s>Look out!</s>
You like?  It's all yours.</s>Mine?</s>My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.</s>Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --</s>Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --</s>Yes, sir.</s>

She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.</s>I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.</s>
You going to tell her?</s>You going to tell him?</s>He doesn't need to know all my business.</s>He's gonna find out.</s>So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?</s>

You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.</s>He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.</s>
Where's Fezzik?</s>I thought he was with you.</s>No.</s>In that case --</s>
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...</s>That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.</s>

I want to buy you a drink.</s>Thanks, Franky.</s>
Alright!</s>We've created a monster.</s>
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.</s>Don't call yourself fat.</s>I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?</s>Heidi - why didn't you come down here?</s>Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.</s>They're not after you, they're after me.</s>Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.</s>
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.</s>You're made for a doctor, young man!</s>I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --</s>You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --</s>I thought only the best students were made assistants.</s>Well?

Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.</s>I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.</s>That didn't sound very convincing.</s>
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!</s>We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!</s>
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?</s>Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'</s>

No doubt you've heard the rumors.</s>I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.</s>My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.</s>Of course.</s>I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.</s>I see.</s>I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.</s>A situation?</s>I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.</s>I'm flattered you think so.</s>I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.</s>Quite.</s>
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.</s>Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.</s>

So then what do you do now?</s>I'm a documentary filmmaker.</s>Oh? Anything I might have seen?</s>N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers.

Busting my ass, for what?</s>To do what you love.</s>I don't know sometimes.</s>You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.

He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me.

And what? These things are octopusses?</s>I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...</s>
Could you do it?</s>No.</s>
Good. You're just what I need right now.</s>You got a minute?</s>It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.</s>Who's doing this?</s>I gotta go.</s>Will you hang on just a second.</s>
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.</s>Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.</s>If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...</s>
The wire's showing!</s>Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --</s>
Welsh again.</s>Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.</s>
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?</s>No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?</s>Sort of.</s>
What?!</s>Good enough.</s>
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?</s>I just finished drying...</s>Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on.</s>
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?</s>An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.</s>How does it work?</s>With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.</s>No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.</s>
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.</s>Unless you get caught.</s>So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.</s>So why have you told me about it?</s>Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.</s>I've got a boyfriend, Mark.</s>What? Steady like?</s>That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.</s>And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?</s>Sixteen next month.</s>Happy birthday.</s>What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?</s>
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?</s>Yeah.</s>What is it?  A Disneyland thing?</s>No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.</s>California, huh?</s>California.</s>
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.</s>Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?</s>I don't know.</s>Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.</s>Frost?</s>Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?</s>It's pretty.</s>I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!</s>Cheers.</s>
She...killed Burke Dennings.</s>What?</s>She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.</s>
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.</s>You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.</s>I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.</s>
Maybe it's legit.</s>Maybe.  I'll call him.</s>
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.</s>It's like War of the Worlds.</s>They think it might happen all at once.</s>
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.</s>Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.</s>
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.</s>You're sometimes not sure?</s>I'm sure. Pretty sure.</s>
Comfortable?</s>As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.</s>We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.</s>
Did we make it?</s>I think --</s>
It will heal.</s>I'm sorry.</s>There's no need to be.</s>
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.</s>Namely?</s>
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!</s>Oh, now--</s>She's going through a really rough time right now.</s>
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.</s>Thanks.</s>
Hold course, Laredo!</s>I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...</s>
What are you doing?</s>Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.</s>
You're a goddess!</s>I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.</s>Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.</s>
I've found it.</s>Found what?</s>What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.</s>
Keep going.</s>Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...</s>
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.</s>Thank you, sir.</s>Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.</s>
To us!</s>Whatever our name is.</s>
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.</s>Really, why's that?</s>I only married you for your body.</s>
Been thinking?</s>No.</s>
This murder was in the papers, right?</s>Yeah.  All over.</s>Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.</s>
Your mother still doesn't like me.</s>I can't name anybody she does like these days.</s>I see she built a place up here by the river.</s>A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--</s>She's done well for herself--on her own and all--</s>So she tells me three times a week.</s>
Miss me, baby?</s>I dunno, boy.</s>Hm?</s>It's a bitch.</s>A bitch.</s>Didn't recognize you.</s>We've never met.</s>I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.</s>I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.</s>I'm gonna wet my pants.</s>
I can't hold the weight of both of you!</s>Hush!</s>
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.</s>I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.</s>
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out.</s>Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.</s>
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.</s>Aw, forget it.</s>Oh, it's wonderful.</s>Hope you enjoy it.</s>
What the hell are you doing?</s>Just getting a feel for her.</s>
What?</s>The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.</s>Well, I've not brought them.</s>It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.</s>Well, I've not brought them.</s>It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.</s>I'm sorry.</s>Bit fucking late, like.</s>Well, why didn't you bring them?</s>Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.</s>Christ.</s>

Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?</s>Yeah, I can.</s>
Why did you do that?</s>I felt like it.</s>Your lips are soft when you kiss.</s>
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?</s>You sure I can't go with ya?</s>
What was that word, young man!?</s>Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-</s>I know what it is!</s>
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.</s>You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.</s>I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.</s>I have to go, Sam.</s>I can come down next week.</s>No.</s>Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?</s>We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!</s>And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?</s>Sam! No!</s>All right.</s>
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.</s>Gus?</s>Superman. The boy you left behind.</s>

That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.</s>We're in there. We're in there --</s>
Excuse me for having something important to do.</s>This isn't important?  The earth is our home.</s>Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.</s>
Now left and that's it in front of you.</s>Good.</s>
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.</s>Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!</s>I beg your pardon?</s>Take a long walk on a short pier.</s>Have a nice day.</s>
The ah... the radio's out.</s>What?</s>Somebody took it out of commission last night.</s>
I got it... boss.</s>He don't sound like he's from 'round here.</s>
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.</s>Perfect, Cole.</s>Let's ride.</s>
Do you notice anything.</s>The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?</s>Swim.</s>Good Idea!</s>
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?</s>It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.</s>Every word, Starling? Every gesture?</s>Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?</s>He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?</s>I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.</s>
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.</s>Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.</s>
What was that she called you, Jimmy?</s>Fergus.</s>
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?</s>Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.</s>Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.</s>I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.</s>How can I serve you in this?</s>Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?</s>If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.</s>Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?</s>
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?</s>YOU!</s>
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.</s>Huh?</s>
Check target approach.</s>Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.</s>Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.</s>When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?</s>As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?</s>
Mornin', ladies.</s>How'do.</s>
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.</s>What? What are you saying?</s>The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.</s>But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!</s>Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.</s>And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?</s>. He will remain always as he is.</s>
Claude...?</s>And you call me a moron...</s>
What the fuck happened to you --</s>What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --</s>
Nice shot.</s>Thank you, sir.</s>I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.</s>Yes, sir, I am.</s>Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.</s>I've tried to change her mind.</s>It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.</s>But how can I do that?</s>If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.</s>
What business meeting?</s>Look at the way I live.</s>I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?</s>What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.</s>I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.</s>Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.</s>
Itís extremely important to my investigation...</s>Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?</s>Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...</s>
Do you, uh, know...</s>Sure, sure.</s>We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.</s>Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.</s>
I think you'll enjoy this table.</s>So long, Father.</s>
Yes?</s>Did you hear?</s>She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --</s>Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.</s>
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?</s>It's alive!</s>
Been here long?</s>Just since yesterday.</s>I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.</s>
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.</s>Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.</s>There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.</s>
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'</s>What we got is just these here.  What you see.</s>It's a short film.</s>They're all about the same. You want something?</s>
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...</s>Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...</s>We did not approach you.</s>
Are you afraid of anything?</s>Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?</s>
Come in.</s>Major Lavallette to see you, General.</s>Send him in.</s>
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?</s>I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.</s>Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..</s>What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?</s>
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.</s>Oh.  Uh-huh.</s>You did work for Emil, right?</s>Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.</s>You were his what, his box?</s>His assistant.</s>
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.</s>And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.</s>
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.</s>Shut it, Teddy.</s>Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.</s>I'll ride with him. You follow.</s>Give me your keys.</s>
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.</s>So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?</s>It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.</s>Why?</s>Because it hasn't all been erased.</s>
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.</s>I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.</s>I really am sorry.</s>
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?</s>Want to look after you.</s>What does that mean?</s>Something I heard someone say once.</s>
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...</s>Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?</s>I require...</s>...yes, yes, yes...</s>
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.</s>Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.</s>Well... the guy's fucked up.</s>
Open the door, Vickie.</s>No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.</s>Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.</s>I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.</s>Aw, c'mon, Vick --</s>I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.</s>
Evening.</s>It can't be.</s>Excuse me?</s>You're Warren Wayne.</s>
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.</s>You working in San Diego now?</s>I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.</s>'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.</s>Was he with a girl?</s>No.</s>Thanks.</s>
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?</s>Where there's life there's hope.</s>
Well...how do you feel?</s>Ask me in about five minutes.</s>
That's not that much.</s>Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.</s>
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.</s>You've got your own TV show?</s>The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.</s>
Where are you going?</s>I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?</s>I have to talk to you.</s>I'll be back later...</s>
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...</s>Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?</s>He just said he had good reasons.</s>Good reasons?</s>That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.</s>His mother would be pleased to hear that.</s>Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.</s>I’m afraid I don’t understand.</s>They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...</s>Do you know Leon’s parents names?</s>Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?</s>
Where did you girls play before?</s>Oh - here and there - and around.</s>
Do you follow her every day?</s>Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.</s>What's her name?</s>I don't know.</s>
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?</s>I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.</s>Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?</s>Sure thing. Come on.</s>
W-w-w-we?</s>That's right.  Your toys.</s>
There is some allusion here that escapes me...</s>We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?</s>Why does everything you say sound like a threat?</s>
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?</s>What kind of wife did you say she was?</s>Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.</s>A child? My uncle's?</s>Yes, sir.</s>That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.</s>I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.</s>If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.</s>
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.</s>Thanks Tom.</s>
I don't want to intrude.</s>We insist.</s>
I'm fine, babe.</s>Give him a minute, Clair.</s>Hey.  Thanks, buddy.</s>Anytime, sport.</s>Yeah, thanks pal.</s>
How ya doin', Toothpick?</s>Fine, now.</s>I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.</s>Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.</s>That I should've picked you up?</s>No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.</s>
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.</s>Hm?</s>You know, clean the pipes.</s>Pipes? What are you talking about?</s>You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.</s>
Mother? Is that you?</s>Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.</s>Is Mr Helpmann here?</s>Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.</s>I want to talk to him.</s>
Well, here's where the fun never stops!</s>Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.</s>Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?</s>
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.</s>Al Capone!</s>My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...</s>Michael...</s>Then the legs at the knees...</s>Michael you're trying to scare me...</s>Then the thighs where they joined the torso.</s>Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...</s>Then Luca turned to the other man...</s>Michael, I love you.</s>...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.</s>
That was D'Agosta.</s>The planetarium!</s>Vince!</s>
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.</s>Who are you?</s>Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.</s>How'd you find me?</s>I'd advise you to hurry.</s>
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?</s>Am I out of here?</s>That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.</s>There were treating me like a headcase.</s>Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?</s>
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!</s>All right, you get out of here, man!</s>Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!</s>That dyin's gonna be done two ways.</s>
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.</s>There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.</s>
Really?</s>Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!</s>
That where he was shot?</s>That's where he fell.</s>You get much of that in here?</s>It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--</s>Deal drugs in the bathroom--</s>If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.</s>
You want the Spencer, Bill?</s>Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.</s>
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .</s>But what can you do? There's no way now . . .</s>I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .</s>
What's the matter with you?</s>Come on, lemme load you up...</s>
"Never cry wolf!"</s>What?</s>My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.</s>"If something really happens"...like what, James?</s>Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...</s>
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?</s>It's had a meal.</s>
Hello? Hello?</s>Where is everyone? I'll ask --</s>
Where will you go?</s>Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.</s>When?</s>Right now, before I back down.</s>Where is he?</s>
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.</s>I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.</s>What do you mean?</s>Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.</s>But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?</s>He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?</s>

He must've snatched you out of the cradle.</s>I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.</s>A long time, with one man.</s>Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --</s>
Want some bridge mix?</s>Oh, no thanks ...</s>Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...</s>I'm fine--but thank you.</s>
Fuck you and stay off the phone.</s>Forget it, Mookie.</s>
Why did you do that?</s>To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...</s>
It's him...Landon.</s>Which one?</s>Second from the left.</s>
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?</s>Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.</s>
I'm only looking out for you.</s>And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.</s>

It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!</s>Very well, madame. Thank you.</s>
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.</s>More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.</s>No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.</s>
Who threw this party, anyway?</s>Damned if I know...</s>
We know what's going on.</s>I still don't know what you're talking about.</s>
What is that?</s>That is my telescope.</s>
I love you, Bud.</s>I love you more.</s>
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?</s>No....I though  I'm afraid.</s>You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.</s>

I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.</s>I hope it's not the oven again.</s>Yeah.</s>Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?</s>
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.</s>A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.</s>Peace is made is such ways.</s>SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!</s>

I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.</s>You mean -- you really want to draw me?</s>Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.</s>But why?</s>Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.</s>And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?</s>What are you suggesting?

I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!</s>At least they weren't lit.</s>I hate this fucking place.</s>Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...</s>Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.</s>All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.</s>I'm not even supposed to be here today!</s>I know.

They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.</s>County water board.  All righty, thanks.</s>Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...</s>

Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?</s>Listen, listen -- I can speak --</s>

Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?</s>I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."</s>Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.</s>Good.

I'm going to see you again, right?</s>If it's okay with you?</s>
Popeye.</s>Yeah.</s>It's Cloudy.  Open the door.</s>I can't.</s>

She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head.

I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.</s>What are they?</s>

There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.</s>Too bad we're heading west.</s>There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.</s>You don't get it, do you?</s>

We met in graveyards to build that union!</s>All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...</s>Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?</s>If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...</s>
The whole world thinks you're underground.</s>I am underground.</s>
I'm sorry.</s>Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.</s>

Be honest.  Okay... Guard!</s>-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...</s>Very good, Brian. -- About your report here.

You're smarter than that, Brian.</s>Trychticholorate.</s>Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees.

Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --</s>I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.</s>
...would you like a drink?</s>No thank you.</s>Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.</s>
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.</s>Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just...</s>Take a hike, you mean?</s>I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.</s>I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.</s>Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?</s>
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?</s>Do you recognize any of them?</s>
No... no thank you notes.</s>Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.</s>Lovely.</s>I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...</s>
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.</s>Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!</s>
What will your father say?</s>As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.</s>What time do they expect us?</s>For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.</s>Michael.</s>Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.</s>
You feel alright today, Daddy?</s>Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!</s>
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.</s>Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?</s>Yes.</s>That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.</s>
Uh-oh.</s>What?!</s>Kkinsa! Open the doors!</s>
Help your mother find the bullet.</s>There it is.  Give it to me.</s>
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.</s>That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.</s>A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?</s>Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.</s>So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.</s>Of course.</s>And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?</s>
Ro, how long have we known each other.</s>I don't think of us that way - ever.</s>Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU.</s>Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.</s>
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.</s>If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.</s>Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.</s>One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!</s>I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?</s>We're not after car thieves here.</s>What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.</s>That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.</s>Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?</s>My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...</s>I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.</s>
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.</s>If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.</s>Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.</s>
...or films you must see or...</s>Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.</s>
He says this is their block.</s>As in, they own it?</s>Something like that...</s>And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?</s>I didn't know that you spoke French.</s>I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.</s>
What's happening to me?</s>Well, that's what we're here for.</s>
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.</s>Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.</s>She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."</s>Is that what you think?</s>Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?</s>We need to talk.</s>I'm late for surgery.</s>It's important.</s>So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...</s>
Lydia?</s>Hello, darling.</s>Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.</s>Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.</s>He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...</s>That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?</s>
When did this happen?</s>Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.</s>Jesus...</s>But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.</s>Maybe you can.</s>
Hi, everybody. Am I late?</s>Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.</s>
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.</s>Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.</s>
Hey!</s>It's the den mother.</s>
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.</s>... Very good, sir.</s>
What do you want? Why are you here?</s>I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --</s>He's not my boyfriend.</s>
Weir.</s>He's dead...</s>
Our time's up.</s>What?!  There's nothing here!</s>Look around...</s>
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.</s>Well ... yes. All right. But -</s>Ah, come on now!</s>
Why did you come to ... my province.</s>We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.</s>You were not coming here, to see me?</s>No -- no, sir.</s>You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?</s>What do you mean, Colonel?</s>What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?</s>You know you're right.</s>
Oh, for Christ's sake –-</s>I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.</s>
Leave it where it is.</s>Wait.  You not Adele?</s>I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.</s>Oh.  Then this must be Adele...</s>
Father--oh.</s>Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.</s>How nice. How do you do, Senator?</s>
Ol' satchel-butt...</s>I know they're gonna buy that stock --</s>
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.</s>...Tomato?</s>Facts is facts. I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house --</s>
250,000?</s>In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.</s>What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.</s>I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.</s>You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.</s>
Would you like to see it?</s>I've seen it.</s>On the back it has--</s>--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.</s>How did you know that?</s>
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.</s>Wait, what happened to the tree?</s>
I'll just say it.</s>I'll say it.</s>OK. Go ahead.</s>On your marks...  Get set go.</s>
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.</s>What's MOW?</s>Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --</s>
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.</s>Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.</s>Mais non, c'est pour toi.</s>Pour moi?</s>Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!</s>Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.</s>Comment va-t-elle?</s>Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.</s>
Is that you, Domino?</s>Nice to see you again, Edna.</s>
Thanks. Have a good one.</s>Do you mind if I drink this here?</s>Sure. Go ahead.</s>
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?</s>Right.</s>
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.</s>Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.</s>Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?</s>Ilene, Rick promised...</s>Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.</s>
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.</s>Who <u>is</u> this??</s>Your mother's pastor.</s>What happened to my Dad??</s>There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.</s>Yes.</s>I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.</s>No.</s>
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!</s>What?</s>
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.</s>We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.</s>
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.</s>Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.</s>
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.</s>How do you do?</s>
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.</s>I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.</s>When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.</s>Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.</s>
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!</s>Yeah.</s>I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.</s>
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?</s>Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.</s>
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.</s>We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.</s>
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.</s>We're all like that.</s>Are you religious?</s>No.</s>You should be.</s>
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?</s>Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.</s>You think she wants us to ease up on the story?</s>I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?</s>
He's history.</s>Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.</s>
I admire him. He's a force of nature.</s>He's just pushy.</s>No... He's determined. Unstoppable --</s>Cocky.</s>Strong.</s>A brute.</s>My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.</s>
How did you know they were Jews?</s>I can tell....</s>How?</s>I was a Jew in a previous life.</s>
I know.</s>So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.</s>
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.</s>Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.</s>
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?</s>It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.</s>Lake Forest Green?</s>Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.</s>
We're breaking up. I am out!</s>Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.</s>
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.</s>This isn't a game.</s>Quite right, but we still make the rules.</s>Rules are made to be broken.</s>People, too.</s>Then who wins?</s>You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...</s>
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?</s>Scout?</s>Marmalade.</s>
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--</s>Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...</s>
I was hoping we could have a special evening.</s>I won't be late.</s>Did something happen today?</s>
We lost.</s>it's okay..</s>
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...</s>Really Biff? The keenest?</s>Oh yeah.</s>Gosh. I hardly know what to say.</s>
Obviously.</s>How many?</s>What do you wanna know for?</s>I just want to know, that's all.</s>What difference does it make?</s>I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...</s>
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -</s>Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -</s>What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?</s>Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -</s>So why don't you just ask him for the money?</s>
Mr. McCleery?</s>You heard me. Out of here.</s>What for?</s>Because I don't like you.</s>
Who was it?</s>What?</s>On the phone. Was it for you?</s>I don't know, he didn't say anything.</s>Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?</s>You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?</s>
What kind of light?</s>He's hallucinating badly.</s>
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.</s>Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.</s>That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.</s>Want to take a poke at him?</s>I didn't mean you, Mister.</s>
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...</s>That's cop bullshit.</s>Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.</s>About what?</s>Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.</s>Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?</s>You, Kelly, Sam.</s>I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...</s>
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...</s>Give her some cigarettes.</s>Das worren nooh zeiten.</s>
Hey...</s>Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers</s>
Bonitas.</s>Something must've scared them.</s>
How come you don't took familiar?</s>Been away. Up to Houston.</s>Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.</s>
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--</s>How are the pigeons?</s>Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.</s>Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.</s>Oh--you are!</s>Then you *did* say it.</s>No--I mean--yes--that is--</s>
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.</s>You sick bastard!</s>
Hello?</s>This is the police, ma'am.</s>
-- Ruined my exit!</s>Help!</s>
You can't take that... It's personal property...!</s>We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.</s>...my files! Personal correspondence...</s>
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.</s>Read it and keep on reading.</s>
Why, what would you do?</s>I could try to...make it stop.</s>No. I don't want it to.</s>So it's helping?</s>
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.</s>We've been working hard too. Takes glass.</s>Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.</s>There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.</s>What did you do that for?</s>For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.</s>I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.</s>Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.</s>Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.</s>A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.</s>Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.</s>
What's this?</s>Your new chair, sir.</s>
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.</s>What about?</s>Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...</s>
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...</s>Who?</s>A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.</s>
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.</s>God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.</s>It's a great song.</s>Thank you.</s>
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --</s>He didn't mess up. There it is ...</s>
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.</s>Youíre probably right.</s>I usually am.</s>Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.</s>You got it.</s>And get a doctor.</s>Good luck.</s>
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.</s>I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.</s>If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:</s>I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.</s>
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...</s>Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?</s>
Yeah. Big fan.</s>And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.</s>Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.</s>No need to be modest, Brian.</s>No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.</s>-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.</s>Every little boy's fantasy.</s>Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.</s>I have a job.</s>This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.</s>Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.</s>Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.</s>
Wasn't no bullet?</s>Yessir. Wasn't none.</s>Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.</s>No sir.</s>You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.</s>Yes sir.</s>Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?</s>Sir, I don't want to picture that.</s>Well I don't either!</s>
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.</s>That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.</s>If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?</s>
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.</s>Don.</s>So...you hang out here a lot?</s>Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.</s>
What generation are you?</s>Nexus - 6.</s>

No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.</s>Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.</s>
Vice... Jesus.</s>That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.</s>
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.</s>No I'm not...</s>We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?</s>
I'm getting tired.</s>Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.</s>
You've got to see the kitchen first.</s>Do you like it?</s>I love your apartment.</s>Really?</s>
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?</s>Absolutely.</s>
There'll be someone else.</s>What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.</s>
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?</s>Nah, man...</s>
Where you signed this?</s>That's right.</s>What happened at that signing?</s>She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.</s>Did she?</s>Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...</s>
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.</s>While you eat, you look at the view.</s>
Where's egghead?</s>His kid's sick.</s>I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.</s>
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.</s>Oh, look at this. Champagne!</s>
Dead.  Trappers killed him.</s>Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?</s>
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?</s>Wake up!</s>Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.</s>It's gonna be hot today.</s>Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.</s>Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.</s>Do me a favor.  Go to work.</s>Later.  Gotta get paid.</s>
Well, what do you want to do?</s>I think I've studied enough.</s>
Sorry, man.  He's dead.</s>No.</s>
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.</s>Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.</s>
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.</s>Are you quite sure?</s>Yes, really, thank you very much.</s>
Lieutenant!  It's me.</s>What is it?</s>Dr. Green has to see you!</s>Got my hands full here.</s>It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.</s>
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.</s>The ticket is 30.55.</s>
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.</s>But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --</s>
Listen, you like beer?</s>I don't know.</s>Want to go out and have one with me?</s>In a saloon?</s>Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .</s>
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?</s>Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.</s>

But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.</s>You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.</s>

Straight ahead.</s>Hard to find doors in this place.</s>

Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?</s>No thank you.</s>The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.</s>
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.</s>Have you known this all along?</s>Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.

Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?</s>Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.</s>Remember, she's a Schuyler.</s>Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.</s>My error.</s>Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.</s>Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now.

Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.</s>I think it's enchanting.</s>

That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.</s>He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?</s>Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.</s>The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?</s>Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.</s>
"Liebestraum."</s>I just played it.</s>Play it again.</s>But that was the fourth straight time.</s>Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.</s>No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."</s>"Liebestraum."</s>Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...</s>My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano.

Isn't that dumb?</s>No.</s>Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!</s>
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?</s>Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.</s>
...his number.</s>I'll look it up for you.</s>Well, look, is there a car here I can use?</s>
...What's so damn strange about that?</s>I didn't say a word.</s>
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!</s>You're sure?!</s>Relatively.</s>

-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?</s>I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.</s>You've never built in Africa.</s>But I have in India- every country presents problems.</s>You'll need your confidence, I promise you.</s>I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.</s>Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.</s>You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.</s>
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?</s>In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.</s>
If you have to work...</s>No, no.  I'm just about...  There.</s>
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.</s>It'll only work for one of us.</s>Yes, sir.</s>We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?</s>There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.</s>
Robert?</s>What?</s>I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.</s>Of course I'd like to.</s>
Boy, am I glad to see you.</s>What are you doing here?</s>We have to talk.</s>Your painful groin?</s>
Liza Sutton is dead.</s>Then I can't be hurt anymore.</s>

How do you know? Did he tell you?</s>Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.</s>
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.</s>I don't get it.</s>It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.</s>What do we do?</s>We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.</s>Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?</s>Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.</s>
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."</s>Yeah?  She said that to you?</s>
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.</s>... I just pray we're not too late.</s>

Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?</s>I haven't heard an official "no" yet.</s>You haven't told then, huh?</s>No.</s>I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...</s>
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?</s>I haven't said anything of the sort.</s>But you would like to know where she is?</s>Yes. There are certain punitive measures...</s>I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.</s>
Why, may one ask?</s>I dream'd a dream to-night.</s>And so did I.</s>Well, what was yours?</s>That dreamers often lie.</s>In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.</s>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!</s>Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.</s>True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.</s>
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?</s>No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.</s>You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.</s>Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.</s>

They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.</s>They let you out?</s>Yeah.</s>How come?</s>They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.</s>Are you well?</s>I reckon I feel all right.</s>You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.</s>
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --</s>Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.</s>I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.</s>I know.

After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.</s>How do you know who's real and who's not?</s>And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.</s>You knew it was me all along?</s>Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.</s>

This better not be a wild goose chase.</s>Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?</s>Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.</s>
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.</s>Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.</s>
What are we downloading?</s>Information.</s>What kind?</s>Profitable.</s>
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.</s>What're you talkin' about?</s>I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.</s>That's a lotta crap.</s>Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.</s>How come I never hearda you before?</s>I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.</s>
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?</s>Peanut butter.</s>
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.</s>Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.</s>

Am I dead?</s>From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.</s>I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.</s>Well, I'll see what I can do about it.</s>I've seen it. It's all pain.</s>You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.</s>
'I am not a missing link.'</s>Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.</s>Well, maybe they're not.</s>No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.</s>Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!</s>Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --</s>
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.</s>Yeah, we'll see.</s>We'll see?  What does that mean?</s>We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.</s>God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.</s>You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'

I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.</s>Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.</s>
What?</s>I said I don't have any.</s>
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!</s>Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.</s>

She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!</s>Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?</s>I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.</s>What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?</s>
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."</s>Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.</s>People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.</s>
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.</s>Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!</s>This is not the time, Diego.</s>
You got the key?</s>Oh yeah.  Violet!</s>
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.</s>Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.</s>Well...</s>Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?</s>
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?</s>Do you like pigeons?</s>That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.</s>

Here, right around Centaurus A.</s>This is how you see the sky?</s>It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.</s>It's beautiful.</s>Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.</s>

Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.</s>Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.</s>Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?</s>Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.</s>

Your private train, sir.</s>Private train?</s>That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.</s>
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-</s>You're sure nobody's following us?</s>As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?</s>No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.</s>What?</s>

That's sad, Mac.</s>
Don't you think there's too much gold?</s>It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...</s>I don't know, I think...</s>Look, would you argue with your doctor?</s>No.</s>

Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...</s>Anything ---</s>It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.</s>What about time...?</s>
Is that your Dad?</s>Yes.</s>Who's that with your Dad?</s>It's my mother.</s>Do you remember her?</s>No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.</s>What do you think it's like?</s>What?</s>Heaven.</s>I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.</s>But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?</s>It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.</s>That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.</s>
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...</s>It didn't bite me.</s>I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.</s>
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.</s>I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.

I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short.

I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!</s>What are you going to do?</s>I'll be all right. You just do as I say.</s>
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.</s>Yeah.  Kidnapping.</s>Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.</s>Pure idiot.</s>I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.

By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.</s>Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?</s>The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.</s>I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.</s>Thanks...</s>Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.</s>Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.</s>Say, could I meet him?</s>Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.</s>You're not afraid, are you?</s>Afraid? I should say not!</s>All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?</s>Better.</s>

Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?</s>No, Your Honor.</s>Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.</s>

Permission to get dressed, sir?</s>It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.</s>Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?</s>For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.</s>I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.</s>Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?</s>
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?</s>283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...</s>Everyone remember where we parked.</s>
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?</s>I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.</s>
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?</s>Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.</s>This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".</s>Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?</s>I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.</s>
Hi.</s>Hello.</s>You disappeared.</s>Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.</s>Well... how have you been?</s>Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...</s>Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...</s>
He's dead, Claudia, dead.</s>The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.</s>
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.</s>Connie.</s>Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?</s>
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.</s>You usually eat alone?</s>Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.</s>Cheers.</s>
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!</s>What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.</s>Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!</s>Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.</s>Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.</s>End my career?</s>How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.</s>But Chief?  Over this??</s>There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.</s>
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.</s>You taking any medication?</s>
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.</s>What does Bob say?</s>He wants to be me... or he will kill me.</s>No... No...</s>Oh, yes... yes...</s>
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.</s>But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.</s>That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.</s>How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?</s>
Two minutes, Alvy.</s>No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.</s>In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.</s>You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-</s>Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.</s>
She's nice lookin'.</s>So what.</s>I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.</s>And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?</s>What d'you mean, any happier?</s>Any happier than any other asshole in life.</s>
I write.</s>Oh yeah? What kind of write?</s>Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.</s>
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?</s>Which one?</s>Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.</s>ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.</s>
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.</s>I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!</s>
They takin' water?</s>Yeah.</s>
It'd cost you.</s>Of course.  How much?</s>Five full nights... days too?</s>
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.</s>Pharmaceutical! You are a god.</s>One for you and one for me.</s>
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.</s>You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!</s>
Not me.</s>Why not?</s>I can't afford to get caught.</s>
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --</s>"Need" is a good, solid word.</s>Nah, sounds too "needy."</s>Start in, you got nachos coming.</s>
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.</s>Which is shit.</s>No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.</s>Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.</s>I'11 find him.</s>Waste of time.</s>A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.</s>What?</s>Nothing. Something I - forget it.</s>
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?</s>....shame on you, truly...</s>
No, that's what makes you unemployed.</s>I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.</s>
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.</s>That's none of your business.  Get the keys.</s>I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.</s>Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?</s>
In a way.</s>If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.</s>So could you.  But our records were a little against us.</s>What your father did doesn't condemn you.</s>Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?</s>The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?</s>
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'</s>Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?</s>I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.</s>The Doctors were not negligent.</s>I... um...</s>
Did you get him?</s>I don't know.  Back the truck--</s>
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?</s>Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.</s>
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?</s>Don't hold me so tight.</s>Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!</s>You're *ticklin' me!*</s>That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*</s>Now I can't breathe.</s>
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --</s>But what?</s>But you already know what I'm going to tell you.</s>I'm not the One.</s>Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.</s>What?</s>Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.</s>
Wasn't it, Keitel?</s>Well... I... I thought...</s>
And you're sure it was a woman?</s>God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.</s>
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?</s>If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?</s>
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.</s>That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.</s>Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.</s>I only did it once and...</s>
Then this must be done tomorrow.</s>What is to be done?</s>
You know, this is crazy.</s>What?</s>Being here, with me.</s>I know.</s>Most people say the odds are against me.</s>What odds?</s>The percentages --</s>

Why?</s>Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.</s>
I guess we can get started.</s>I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.</s>
Say it.</s>Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.</s>A Russian?</s>It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.</s>Last week? When?</s>
Good evening, sir.</s>Good evening, Mademoiselle.</s>
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.</s>Don't be an idiot.</s>
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.</s>But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.</s>Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.</s>
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.</s>You heard the boss! Let's move!</s>
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.</s>You're lying...!</s>I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.</s>Starck... Cooper...</s>
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.</s>The report didn't mention nails and eyes.</s>Why do you think he took his gloves off?</s>Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?</s>'Intimate? !"</s>Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.</s>
I was a slave.</s>In Virginia.</s>I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...</s>China.</s>Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.</s>
Are you relieved?</s>Yes, but --</s>
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...</s>All we have to do now is sell it to the President.</s>
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?</s>Victor did.</s>
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?</s>It is a difficult situation.</s>I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?</s>Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.</s>
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?</s>Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.</s>I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--</s>Just call me Spidey.</s>Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?</s>Thanks, I already ate.</s>I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?</s>Well...</s>
Senorita Josie.</s>And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?</s>
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.</s>Really?</s>Yes.  This one though is... very good.</s>
Were you an alcoholic?</s>No.</s>Were you a drug addict?</s>No. Never.</s>
Another satisfied client?</s>Another satisfied client's wife.</s>
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".</s>Oh, Leland.</s>
...I don't guess this means much to you.</s>Hell, I could tell you some stories–</s>And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.</s>I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.</s>Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?</s>I can feel my butt getting sore already.</s>Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!</s>And I could tell you some stories –</s>Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.</s>Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.</s>Frequently played, seldom remarked.</s>
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?</s>Yeah, sure.</s>OK. Bye.</s>Maybe she has caller ID.</s>
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!</s>I refuse!</s>I said out!</s>No!</s>I'm the coach!</s>I just started!</s>You can come back later!</s>I don't trust you!</s>Scanlon out!</s>
Oh.</s>We're waiting on Carmine.</s>Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.</s>
What... ?  Not you too?</s>He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.</s>I can't believe I'm hearing this,</s>I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.</s>That's not true.</s>I know it is, even if you don't.</s>
No --</s>One more. Smile. One more.</s>No, c'mon --</s>I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.</s>
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.</s>Now tell me, why would I want to do that?</s>Because I don't want to see him hurt.</s>Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?</s>I can't...and I won't.</s>Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.</s>Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.</s>You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.</s>You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.</s>Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.</s>
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.</s>Why</s>Because I have something very important to do.</s>What?</s>I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.</s>When?</s>
You...made that?</s>I said I did, didn't I!</s>
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.</s>When did you first notice this?</s>Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?</s>
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...</s>Uh-oh.</s>
I really should change.</s>No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.</s>I mean put clothes on.</s>Here, take mine.</s>
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!</s>That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.</s>
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?</s>I have not read you your rights.</s>Would you mind saying that into your bag...?</s>I hereby acknowledge that...</s>And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.</s>Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?</s>To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...</s>Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?</s>If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.</s>
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.</s>I'd put my money on that Vigo character.</s>
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.</s>Elroy.</s>Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.</s>Okay.  Bye, Craig.</s>
You have every right to be upset.</s>Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."</s>I never meant to imply...</s>How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?</s>
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!</s>Say, Schulz --</s>Jawohl?</s>Sprechen Sie deutsch?</s>Jawohl.</s>Then droppen Sie dead!</s>Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!</s>
This... is my new home?</s>Yes.</s>The hospital?</s>Of course! What did you think?</s>
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.</s>Open it.</s>
No!</s>I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!</s>
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?</s>Fine.  What the hell is going on?</s>Please, sit.</s>
Brother and sister no more.</s>Now husband and wife.</s>
George Bailey lassos stork.</s>Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?</s>
Why'd you do that?</s></s>
Definitely!</s>I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.</s>
Yeah.</s>Thank God we got you away from her, huh?</s>
Merci.</s>We're not outta here yet.</s>
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?</s>I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.</s>About Suzie?</s>Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.</s>He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.</s>
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.</s>Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.</s>
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.</s>It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.</s>No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?</s>
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.</s>I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.</s>If that is your destiny.</s>Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.</s>It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.</s>
You guys are my parents.</s>Of course we are.</s>They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...</s>
So you're talking to me?</s>When I have something to say.</s>
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.</s>Let me get this straight...</s>If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.</s>These are real, live women?</s>We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.</s>God, I love being dead.</s>
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.</s>One would assume so.</s>
Then I don't get anything either.</s>And I realized, he's taking a chance too.</s>
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?</s>No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --</s>You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.</s>You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!</s>Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.</s>Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!</s>Get out!</s>But it's not on the schedule!</s>You got to hell!</s>
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.</s>Susan.</s>

Don't you wonder what he died from?</s>No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?</s>It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.</s>Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.</s>Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.</s>
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!</s>Oh, well...</s>Oh well!

Sorry about that...</s>No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.</s>Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.</s>

So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?</s>Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.</s>Or else what?</s>Or else use your fucking imagination.</s>
He came in through the cupboard.</s>You little liar! Get out of here!</s>

What's wrong with me?</s>I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --</s>Give me a mirror...</s>
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?</s>I have a television.</s>NO--!</s>
Do you hear anything?</s>Only silence. It's always like this.</s>And no birds sing.</s>No birds live here.</s>No.</s>
Jesus.</s>What?</s>That's the <u>reason</u>.</s>
You don't understand.</s>Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.</s>This has nothing to do with that.</s>
Are you okay?</s>Hurry up, for Christ's sake!</s>
Does she wear glasses?</s>No.</s>I've got to ask somebody.</s>
Jessie!  Are you alright?</s>I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?</s>Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.</s>Love's a killer, isn't it?</s>

Whatever, you come recommended. We...</s>Recommended?</s>Must I speak to you in French?</s>Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?</s>You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.</s>Okay. Recommended...</s>Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?</s>Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.</s>What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!</s>
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...</s>Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.</s>
Let's move.</s>I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.</s>
Where does he think he's going?</s>When you gotta go, you gotta go.</s>
How's that?</s>Kind of sore.</s>You'll live.</s>Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?</s>Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.</s>So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?</s>I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.</s>Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...</s>
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?</s>No! I've got more than one shirt!</s>She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.</s>Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.</s>
All it takes is a long arm.</s>Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.</s>I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.</s>This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...</s>
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.</s>Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.</s>
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.</s>Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?</s>
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?</s>No, he got hit by a bus.</s>Oh... Can I help you?</s>Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?</s>Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.</s>I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.</s>Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.</s>Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?</s>The white kind.</s>I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?</s>Actually, it is kind of rough.</s>Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.</s>Yeah, but...</s>Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.</s>Yeah, okay. Go ahead.</s>Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.</s>
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?</s>Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.</s>Let's go the zoo.</s>Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.</s>
You see it?</s>Yes.</s>Where does it lead?</s>It must be a closet or something.</s>
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!</s>I'm sorry.</s>Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!</s>I'm saying it now!</s>So you met somebody else?</s>Yeah.</s>
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.</s>Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>?</s>
Jerry Lundegaard.</s>All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?</s>Well... yah.</s>Know who this is?</s>Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?</s>Circumstances have changed, Jerry.</s>Well, what do ya mean?</s>Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..</s>What the - how's Jean?</s>
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?</s>You didn't say anything about my hair.</s>
I'm in pain.</s>You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.</s>
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?</s>Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.</s>I hope it's nothing serious.</s>
It wasn't a lunatic.</s>I beg your pardon?</s>It was a wolf.</s>What?</s>A wolf.</s>
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?</s>...what's he got against you?</s>He once made me an improper suggestion.</s>
...you shoot a great game of pool.</s>So do you, Fast Eddie.</s>
What are you thinking?</s>A lot of things I'd like to forget.</s>That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental</s>I can't blame the ocean--it's you.</s>You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.</s>
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...</s>Well, not exactly.</s>For a while.</s>Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.</s>
He tried to borrow money from us.</s>What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.</s>He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.</s>It's on an island that no one get to.</s>But he has been there, off course.</s>It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.</s>
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.</s>Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...</s>
What're you, a bag lady?</s>I go back to work tomorrow.</s>You talk them into it?</s>They seem to like the idea.</s>Bring the money in and they follow it?</s>Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.</s>You don't actually do it that way?</s>He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.</s>Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.</s>Right around here, in the food court.</s>Sit down, leave the bag under the table?</s>
No! I don't want to leave you!!</s>Mathilda, listen!</s>No, no! I don't want to go!  I don't want!</s>
Relax.</s>Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.</s>[Pointedly] Of course you're not.</s>
Take me down there.</s>It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.</s>Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?</s>Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--</s>Come on, we're wasting time.</s>
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...</s>Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.</s>So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.</s>
Madmartigan, I need your help.</s>My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.</s>
Where are you from, Henrietta?</s>Johana... New York.</s>What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?</s>He doesn't hear too well.</s>
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?</s>-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.</s>
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.</s>Headquarters!? What is it?</s>It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?</s>
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?</s>I think most people right now have other priorities.</s>
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.</s>Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.</s>
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.</s>Uh-oh...</s>It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?</s>
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.</s>You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.</s>I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.</s>
What's all this then?</s>This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.</s>I don't like that word much, Carter.</s>We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.</s>Is that a fact?</s>
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.</s>I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?</s>Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.</s>
Come on!</s>Static!</s>
20 bucks?</s>Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.</s>
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?</s>What do you mean?</s>You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?</s>I guess so.</s>So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.</s>Of course.</s>So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.</s>
Hey baby...</s>Peanut...</s>
You like to open me, don't you?</s>Yes.</s>What if I told Frank that you opened me?</s>
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.</s>Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.</s>
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.</s>Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.</s>So you tell Mitchell ...</s>
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.</s>I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.</s>
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.</s>Yeah, whatever.</s>I mean it!</s>Adios.</s>
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.</s>Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?</s>The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.</s>I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?</s>Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.</s>No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.</s>Your Excellency!</s>You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.</s>
Hold it, mister.</s>What do you think of that? Or this?</s>
If you have to ask, you don't know.</s>Yeah, that's why I asked.</s>You certainly did.</s>I know I did.</s>Sorry, no further questions.</s>
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.</s>Are you sure?</s>
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.</s>Someday, I'll pay it all back.</s>I know.  H-how much do you need?</s>Two thousand dollars.</s>
What are we going to do!</s>Who's got matches?</s>
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?</s>His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.</s>
So was he scared?</s>Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.</s>
What are you doing?</s>I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.</s>But they don't have a case against you.</s>Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.</s>Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!</s>Don't make no difference no more.</s>Can't you get the money from your friends?</s>What friends?</s>
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?</s>Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...</s>You cheap honky sonofabitch...</s>Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!</s>The cops?</s>There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!</s>Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.</s>
I heard that!</s>I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.</s>
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.</s>We only live a few blocks apart.</s>This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.</s>Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.</s>
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.</s>I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.</s>
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?</s>I just turned twenty.</s>
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.</s>No. They don't.</s>Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?</s>
I haven't done anything.</s>Don't be so sure.</s>
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.</s>When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.</s>I don't think he wants me to find him.</s>
She's good, Bennie.</s>She's damn good, Lou.</s>
Miss Bennett please!</s>This is outrageous!</s>
So, talk.</s>We think we got a rat in the house.</s>
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?</s>About - thirty-four seconds.</s>We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.</s>
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?</s>I remember.</s>Do you remember what you said?</s>Yes. I said this is too good to live...</s>
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.</s>Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.</s>Killing her won't solve anything.</s>A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.</s>Well then, I'll pray for rain.</s>See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.</s>Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.</s>Just saying it's not hard to end a life.</s>There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.</s>
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--</s>Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....</s>
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.</s>You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.</s>
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.</s>I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...</s>
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.</s>Yeah, I dig him.</s>Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?</s>
Don’t stop asking questions, okay?</s>Okay.</s>
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.</s>Maybe Hawaii.</s>
Hey, don't take the car!</s>Well, how'll I get home?</s>Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!</s>
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.</s>That's a good idea, sire.</s>What do you mean?</s>Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...</s>... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!</s>
<u>WHY</u>?</s>He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.</s>
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.</s>I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.</s>We're not skipping this treatment.</s>I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.</s>Fuck you.</s>Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.</s>That shit's saving your life, you asshole!</s>
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.</s>Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.</s>No, we are not.</s>
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?</s>Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.</s>

Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.</s>What's our weapons situation?</s>
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.</s>Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.</s>What is the service, sir?</s>There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.</s>
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.</s>Uncommon, too.</s>I imagine so.</s>It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.</s>A man should have a hobby.</s>It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.</s>Is your time so empty?</s>Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.</s>You go out... with friends?</s>Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?</s>Only my share.</s>Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...</s>I'm looking for a private island.</s>What are you running away from?</s>Why do you ask that?</s>No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.</s>Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.</s>I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.</s>You should... mind it.</s>Oh I do... but I say I don't.</s>If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.</s>Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.</s>She sounded strong...</s>I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.</s>Except you.</s>A son is a poor substitute for a lover.</s>Why don't you go away?</s>To a private island, like you?</s>No, not like me.</s>It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.</s>Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...</s>

I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.</s>You're leaving tomorrow?</s>In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.</s>That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.</s>Dear, sweet Hawkeye.</s>Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.</s>You're on his side all of the sudden?</s>A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.</s>How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?</s>It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.</s>You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.</s>
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.</s>I'm sure you'll figure it out.</s>
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?</s>Because that's where I found it. I was there.</s>

Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...</s>Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.</s>
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?</s>Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!</s>You're a great teacher, Lloyd.</s>
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?</s>It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?</s>Well... is it so urgent?</s>If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.</s>
They're all over everybody.</s>I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.</s>
"Deception..." "Lies."</s>Well... Sort of...</s>We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.</s>

And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...</s>
Officer, I killed those people last night.</s>You did, did you?</s>

So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system.

Yeah.</s>Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?</s>I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?</s>

Do you play the piano?</s>Come one Will. I just want to know.</s>I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.</s>I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.</s>Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.</s>So, do you play the piano?</s>Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--</s>--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--</s>--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.</s>

Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.</s>Well, there's not much to tell.</s>I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.</s>Bad experiences.</s>You met people.</s>Bad people.</s>Watched television?</s>Bad television.</s>Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.</s>What's that?</s>It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.</s>That'd be good.</s>
Are you okay?</s>Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.</s>You'd be surprised.</s>Really? I'd like to find out.</s>
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.</s>That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...</s>

Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?</s>No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?</s>It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.</s>
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.</s>What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.</s>

I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.

The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.</s>You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?</s>That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.</s>But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?</s>In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.</s>So what do I do?</s>Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.</s>You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.</s>
You're shaking.</s>It's the tension.</s>
Please sit.</s>I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?</s>Put them down.</s>I heard you met Shu Lien today.</s>Do you know her?</s>She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.</s>
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.</s>Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.</s>Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.</s>
What needs sorting out?</s>Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.</s>Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.</s>We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...</s>Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.</s>We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?</s>Yeah.</s>Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?</s>I dunno.</s>Think about it, Rob.</s>
It was stolen!</s>Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.</s>
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.</s>What kind, Mom?</s>Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.</s>
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.</s>Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?</s>Well, I—</s>I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?</s>
Yeah... rye whiskey?</s>Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...</s>
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?</s>It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.</s>I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.</s>
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.</s>Perhaps not.</s>
What are you doing?!!</s>If the ship goes, so does Jaso.</s>Rizzo pull the fucking lever!</s>No.</s>
You did that, didn't you...?</s>Talking to me dear...?</s>
Hey.</s>Hi.</s>I need to talk to you for a second.</s>What?</s>You gotta give me some money.</s>
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?</s>Handsomely?... Who sent you?</s>Pardon me?</s>Never mind. I'm the owner.</s>
Look, the sky is blue...</s>The sun! That's it!</s>
Was that it? Well, ok.</s>I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.</s>
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!</s>It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.</s>
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.</s>Joy, rapture...</s>Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.</s>
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.</s>It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.</s>
I don't even know you.</s>You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.</s>
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.</s>Well do something about it.</s>
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?</s>I understand the business reasons.</s>Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.</s>
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...</s>This place is deluxe.  You got cable?</s>...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.</s>
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]</s>Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?</s>What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]</s>

Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.</s>It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.</s>
What'd he say now?</s>It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...</s>
This will be a different kind of device.</s>That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?</s>I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.</s>I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.</s>It will.</s>
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.</s>Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.</s>
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.</s>You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.</s>And how did you get it?</s>
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?</s>No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.</s>

I get my occasional crushes.</s>Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]</s>Goodnight, Jasper.</s>Goodnight.</s>
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.</s>He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?</s>But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.</s>
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?</s>Three years.  Sister.</s>Three years.  A rookie.</s>A novice.</s>Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?</s>

Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.</s>Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?</s>
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.</s>Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.</s>Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.</s>
Jesus.  You done this before?</s>Plenty of times.</s>
Vannacutt!!</s>Or somebody wanting me to believe that.</s>
I suppose...you think I should thank you.</s>Yes, you should.</s>
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?</s>You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.</s>
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?</s>Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....</s>

Jody. Wait.</s>What?</s>I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.</s>Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.</s>
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?</s>Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.</s>
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.</s>This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?</s>There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?</s>I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.</s>
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?</s>I am butcher.</s>You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?</s>You stuff sausage in it.</s>And what do you do with the bones?</s>Dog food.</s>
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.</s>Won't that mean you're dead?</s>Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.</s>Dixie McCoy didn't.</s>The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.</s>Okay fine. Let's get this over with.</s>
What's the matter?</s>I lost my wallet.</s>The check, Bruce!</s>
No.</s>Have you had one?</s>Never.</s>But, for a time... a passing fancy?</s>Not even that.</s>How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?</s>Not one.</s>Have you not a man whom you value?</s>That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.</s>What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?</s>Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.</s>Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.</s>Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.</s>It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.</s>But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.</s>That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.</s>It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.</s>I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.</s>A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.</s>I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.</s>How so?</s>By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.</s>
Come on, come on!</s>Hurry up!</s>

Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?</s>It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.</s>She answered our prayers.</s>Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.</s>
My father didn't die in a fire?</s>Huh?</s>My father didn't die in a fire?</s>Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.</s>Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?</s>Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.</s>
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?</s>Yes sir. I can find it by myself.</s>
Did you see it here in New York?</s>San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.</s>

You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.</s>
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.</s>I'd like to jerk and press those babies.</s>
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?</s>Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.</s>
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!</s>Spare your energy.  I'll be back!</s>
Good point.</s>Let's try down here...</s>
Let's consummate our fiendish union!</s>I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.</s>I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!</s>Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!</s>

She's not accustomed to being ignored.</s>She'll have to learn.</s>What about school?</s>
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.</s>Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.</s>When I finally get kissed, I'll know.</s>

What do you think?</s>I think you better put him on ice, man.</s>He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.</s>If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?</s>
She was gonna get away.</s>Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!</s>

He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?</s>Has he?</s>In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?</s>No.</s>
You would not leave me?</s>I must. Look-- how pale the window.</s>Moonlight!</s>No, the morning rooster woke me.</s>It was the owl--come to bed</s>

Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?</s>Pardon me?</s>Your desert island top-five.</s>Oh boy... In the club, or at home?</s>Is there a difference?</s>OF COURSE...

...Need a hand with those bags?</s>No, thanks, I can manage.</s>
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.</s>Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.</s>Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.</s>I don't know anybody.</s>Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.</s>Well, he knows a little about me.</s>You didn't tell him your name, did ya?</s>I told him my first name, and where I'm from.</s>
I hope you like it.</s>It looks wonderful. And so do you.</s>Oh...</s>
How's that?</s>Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.</s>

Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.</s>He's still married though, huh?</s>Technically.  They're separated.</s>Oh, he's moved out?</s>He's about to.</s>Then they're not separated, are they?</s>Can we change the subject?</s>What're you doing at Glades?</s>Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.</s>You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.</s>No thanks.</s>You used to like it.</s>Dad...</s>You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.</s>I really gotta go.</s>We don't get to talk much any more.</s>How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?</s>I'd like that.</s>

Did you go to bat for me?</s>I batted!</s>You batted or you bunted?</s>Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.</s>Well, then I'm quitting.</s>Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."</s>Who's in it?</s>

Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.</s>Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?</s>
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?</s>Never.</s>You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?</s>I mean really never.</s>I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.</s>
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.</s>It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.</s>Uh huh.</s>My husband the hero.</s>

You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.</s>I have a job.</s>This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.</s>You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.</s>Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.</s>Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --</s>Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.</s>
New Mecca....</s>Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?</s>It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.</s>

Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.</s>I understand.</s>As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.</s>

You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?</s>No, Harry! I thought --</s>I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.</s>

The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.</s>That could be possible...</s>But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.</s>A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!</s>That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov.

You better be married.</s>
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.</s>But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.</s>

Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...</s>Uhm hmm.</s>Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...</s>You're attractive, Tita.

No ..........I.</s>I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.</s>She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.</s>She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.</s>I think I've been hurt.</s>Oh...</s>
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --</s>-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...</s>We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.</s>We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?</s>No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!</s>
Willard...</s>It's not a guy...</s>It's a town!</s>
I'm really tired.</s>Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?</s>No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.</s>They say sex is great for cramps.</s>Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.</s>
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?</s>An Austrian.</s>An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?</s>Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?</s>
It will be a good harvest this year.</s>Can you really tell from doing that?</s>What do you think?</s>I think you just like to eat dirt.</s>
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!</s>If any!</s>Yes, let the joyous news be spread.</s>
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!</s>It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.</s>
For instance, something like this?</s>Very nice.  I'll take it.</s>Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?</s>All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.</s>Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.</s>I don't need a little.  I need a lot.</s>Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.</s>What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?</s>Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.</s>
Whose place is this again?</s>It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.</s>I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.</s>How come he let you go?</s>'Cause I didn't ask him.</s>Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.</s>Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.</s>
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.</s>Why can't we just talk to the authorities?</s>Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.</s>Then what else can we do?</s>Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.</s>Who?</s>
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?</s>My wife. Where were we?</s>Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."</s>Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.</s>

Nobody's going anywhere--</s>--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--</s>--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here.

Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.</s>Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.</s>

Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?</s>I didn't have the time.</s>Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.</s>
Is it the money thing?</s>Is what the money thing?</s>With Maya.</s>Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.</s>Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?</s>Slaughterhouse.</s>Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.</s>

ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.</s>Where's my pill...?</s>
What are you doing?</s>It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.</s>
I have to go home, Sanchez.</s>Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.</s>
What? What?</s>So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.</s>What?</s>Shhh...</s>
Proceed.</s>Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?</s>
I was just the accountant.</s>Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?</s>
Get on the expressway.</s>Where are we going?</s>
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.</s>But you didn't.</s>No. Poetic justice, though.</s>
Did he pay you for this?</s>Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.</s>
It literally is Genesis...</s>The power of creation --</s>Have they proceeded with their experiments?</s>The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --</s>
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --</s>Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.</s>
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.</s>Good luck.</s>
Some other guy?</s>Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.</s>Holy shit.</s>So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.</s>
I can take care of myself.</s>I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.</s>
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.</s>No one ever said you were, Mitch.</s>I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.</s>
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -</s>That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.</s>I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?</s>
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.</s>I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.</s>
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?</s>Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.</s>About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.</s>
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.</s>What makes you so sure?</s>Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.</s>
Age?</s>Fifteen.</s>Address?</s>Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!</s>Occupation?</s>
All this for laying traps on private land?</s>You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.</s>
Beautiful!</s>What was?</s>A girl.</s>
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.</s>Thanks...partner.</s>
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?</s>That's why.  Sid.</s>Sure is a hairy fellah.</s>No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!</s>
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.</s>Why?</s>Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.</s>You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?</s>Yes.</s>I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.</s>
We already know. All about it.</s>It was on the television.</s>
See ya, Bandit.</s>See ya, Kate.</s>
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.</s>Where the hell are you?</s>I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.</s>It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.</s>
What's up?</s>I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...</s>
</s></s>
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?</s>Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.</s>The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?</s>No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.</s>I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.</s>But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...</s>
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?</s>Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...</s>I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.</s>
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?</s>Security consultant.</s>Where?</s>Government. Recently retired.</s>Where in government?</s>...Central... Intelligence... Agency...</s>Where?</s>The C.I.A.</s>
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?</s>Should I?</s>A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?</s>Yes.</s>...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.</s>The Big Boy did...?</s>That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.</s>Huh.</s>Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?</s>Me, too.</s>Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?</s>
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?</s>A-fuckin'-men!</s>
You don't have any clothes on.</s>How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.</s>Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.</s>Things always look much worse in the morning.</s>I don't know how to make her funny.</s>You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.</s>What what's about?</s>I...wait, what are you talking about?</s>
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...</s>Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.</s>Excuse me. I really must he going.</s>No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.</s>
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?</s>It was magnificent, man!</s>

Limos, huh?</s>Don't start.</s>Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.</s>She hears what she wants to hear, okay?</s>Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.</s>Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.</s>It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.</s>Yeah?  What happened?</s>He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...</s>What happened?</s>I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.</s>I'm sorry.</s>Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.</s>It's not bullshit.</s>What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.</s>I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...</s>Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?</s>I told you I don't like to talk about it.</s>Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?</s>See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.</s>What, no insurance?</s>Doesn't cover everything.</s>Good excuse.  How many others you got?</s>
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.</s>I was a great beauty.</s>Uh, how did this personality come about?</s>I was very charming.</s>There were many men interested in you?</s>Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.</s>

Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.</s>What?!</s>
That's a lot of butler.</s>Quite.  Come, let's mingle.</s>Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.</s>
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.</s>Oh --</s>
Please drink your coffee.</s>I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.</s>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.</s>You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?</s>Wandering about.</s>You like it, too.</s>
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.</s>Yonder.</s>
Yes. It's you Leia.</s>I know. Somehow...I've always known.</s>Then you know why I have to face him.</s>No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.</s>No, you don't. You've always been strong.</s>But, why must you confront him?</s>Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.</s>

You are not allowed to act this way.</s>Why not?</s>
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?</s>Please sit down...</s>You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.</s>I see.</s>Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.</s>And what's that?</s>Normal. Average.</s>All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.</s>...Did you really say that?</s>Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.</s>This whole thing is a joke!</s>Stay calm, please.</s>No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"</s>I'll have someone show you to your room.</s>Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.</s>
Then they lost?</s>Why does it matter?</s>If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.</s>Why do you care?</s>They're my team.</s>No. They're not your team. They're my team.</s>
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?</s>*You* taught her, I suppose...</s>That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?</s>
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?</s>Killed?  I don't know anything about it.</s>
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.</s>So let's haul ass, Sergeant.</s>
Thank ye.</s>It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?</s>I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.</s>Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.</s>I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.</s>
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...</s>Andy!</s>

There's no way to lock it.</s>What do we do?</s>
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.</s>You didn't cuff her?</s>She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.</s>

What happened between you and the blonde?</s>What?</s>The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.</s>It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.</s>Did she leave you?

Shut up and drive!</s>Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!</s>
Jade, you're late.</s>I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?</s>
What do you do?</s>What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.</s>
You never mentioned his mental state.</s>He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.</s>
Stop it.</s>Okay, "mom."</s>
Daniel, give him the Trix.</s>Susan, this is the future of America here.</s>

Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...</s>Can't you make other creations?</s>I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--</s>
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.</s>Well, you can't do that because he's dead.</s>
Will you take me home now?</s>I'm sorry I took you in there.</s>I think I'd better go home now please.</s>But, Elaine --</s>Where is the car?</s>I just want to tell you something.</s>
We're not finished yet --</s>You wanna bet?</s>
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.</s>Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.</s>
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?</s>Fifty pounds? What for?</s>Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.</s>Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!</s>No, then.</s>
This cannot be.</s>It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.</s>Agreed.</s>I would like to say goodbye.</s>How?</s>
So that's all you do?...</s>Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.</s>
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.</s>I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.</s>Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!</s>Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.</s>A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.</s>Is that what this is about? Material wealth?</s>What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.</s>The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.</s>Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?</s>
And as an investment in the future...</s>"Future" of...?</s>
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?</s>Yeah, you're the worm guy.</s>The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?</s>No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.</s>It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?</s>
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.</s>If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.</s>You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.</s>
He really was!</s>Uh-huh.</s>Well, aren't you excited?</s>Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.</s>
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.</s>Do you know Tom?</s>
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?</s>No, my son's discovered the games room.</s>Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?</s>

You okay?</s>Great.</s>
You have no right to...</s>Cool it, Babe, you started this...</s>
You got kids?</s>Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.</s>Yeah, same here.</s>
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--</s>Sorry.</s>What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?</s>
So... you just moved here?</s>Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.</s>Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?</s>He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.</s>
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.</s>Seven thousand...</s>He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.</s>Cash and what?</s>Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...</s>Never heard of it.</s>Oh, you would have done great.</s>I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.</s>That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.</s>
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.</s>Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?</s>Uh huh.

Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!</s>Neo, this has to be done!</s>Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?</s>What are you talking about?</s>The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...</s>
So he popped the pane?</s>Bingo.</s>
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!</s>He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.</s>Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!</s>
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?</s>If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.</s>
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.</s>I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?</s>I need your help--</s>
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.</s>Why should we care?</s>Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.</s>Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?</s>Is the death of one species less tragic than another?</s>Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.</s>
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?</s>Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.</s>

When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.</s>Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.</s>In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.</s>Good. See you later.</s>You're a drunk and an idiot.</s>You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.</s>Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."</s>
SHIT.</s>MOVE YOUR ASS!</s>

What are you doing in here?</s>Having a nervous breakdown.</s>
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!</s>Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!</s>
Buffy?  What's wrong?</s>Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.</s>Who?</s>Merrick...</s>
No.</s>I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?</s>
You are a monster, Zorg!</s>I know...</s>
Hey, come on, man! Limo!</s>Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?</s>
You got me something?  What's the occasion?</s>You deserve it is the occasion.</s>
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?</s>Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.</s>
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.</s>We don't have time to argue, Susan.</s>
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?</s>They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.</s>
We're not running a dating service here.</s>I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.</s>
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.</s>Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?</s>Maybe less...</s>
The boss is getting hoarse.</s>There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.</s>
Jean? Sorbet?</s>Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.</s>
I know...it sounds insane.</s>You said it.</s>

Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.</s>Any leads?</s>We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.</s>It's my responsibility.</s>
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!</s>I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.</s>Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-</s>
Is there something wrong, sir?</s>Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?</s>Why, yes, actually.  Death and chance stole your parents.  But rather than become a victim, you have done everything in your power to control the fates.  For what is Batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death itself.</s>
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.</s>Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--</s>Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.</s>I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.</s>Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...</s>
Take a drink, Kid.</s>Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.</s>
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?</s>That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.</s>I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.</s>Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.</s>
Do you know what to do?</s>I don't think he's breathing.</s>
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.</s>Why?  Is he staying?</s>With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.</s>We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?</s>They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.</s>In that case, I suppose we can't charge.</s>
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?</s>Is "he" inside?</s>But of course...</s>Alone or surrounded?</s>A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.</s>
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.</s>I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-</s>I should have known. She had no sincerity —- no real belief.</s>
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.</s>Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.</s>
Cigarette?</s>Thank you.</s>Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?</s>No.</s>I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.</s>May I ask what has happened?</s>As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"</s>
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.</s>I don't see that there's anything to say.</s>
Have you seen a woman about so high?</s>No.</s>She had on high heels?</s>No.</s>Need a ride?</s>
You the magician?</s>No.</s>Oh.  What do you do?</s>
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.</s>I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.</s>I'll be the judge of that.</s>
You're it.</s>Am not.</s>Are, too.</s>D2.</s>
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...</s>How is he -- ?</s>They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...</s>

Anyroad, I'd better get back.</s>Yes.</s>See you.</s>Of course.</s>
Most of the times.</s>Not every day?</s>
Wait. Don't.</s>I don't like things that make you cry.</s>I just want to look ...</s>
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...</s>Then get a goddamn snow blower!</s>
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!</s>Does it hurt?</s>Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!</s>
Where the hell were you?</s>Late.</s>I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?</s>
Hey.</s>Are you lost?</s>Nope - just came by to chat</s>We don't chat.</s>Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.</s>We're not.</s>
Don't stop!</s>What is it? What do you see?!</s>Those men in front, in the car.</s>Do you know them?!</s>No... but...</s>Keep going. Go around to the back.</s>
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.</s>Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?</s>Is that a fact?</s>No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.</s>Fire insurance!</s>Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.</s>
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?</s>Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.</s>By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?</s>I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...</s>
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.</s>Ok. Ssh. Rest.</s>
Hey.</s>I heard what you did. Thank you.</s>
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.</s>Me an' you both.</s>
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.</s>He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.</s>
What's happening?</s>Debbie's marrying Rick.</s>...Really?</s>
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!</s>Talk what? I do not know anything!</s>How many do you want? A thousand?</s>
What the fuck's going on here?</s>Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?</s>Why?</s>Does she, goddamnit??</s>Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.</s>
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.</s>She looks terrible, just awful.</s>Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.</s>She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.</s>Afraid of the hospital?</s>Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.</s>A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?</s>Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.</s>Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.</s>
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?</s>Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.</s>
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...</s>Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...</s>
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.</s>Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?</s>Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face</s>You were following us?</s>Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?</s>
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.</s>Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.</s>
What happened?</s>I don't know.</s>I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.</s>You were behind me?  Running after me?</s>
Where are you going?</s>We have to get off this ship.</s>
Close as I can get, el-tee!</s>Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!</s>
He's preaching.</s>These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.</s>
...have you come back?</s>Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.</s>Oh ....</s>
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?</s>It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...</s>That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...</s>What else is there?</s>And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.</s>It's not just in my head.</s>
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.</s>This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.</s>Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.</s>My greatness is better demonstrated with this.</s>
Two years.</s>Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".</s>No.  They've been training to hunt you.</s>

Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?</s>NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!</s>
Oh, I'm sorry.</s>It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.</s>
What's the green stuff poking out?</s>That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?</s>Naw, I already ate.</s>Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.</s>
Quite a shithole, isn't it?</s>It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?</s>I was in jail.</s>The whole time? Eighteen years?</s>No. Two times.</s>What...</s>Check forging.</s>Oh, man! So...</s>The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...</s>So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."</s>I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.</s>
ANGEL...</s>Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright</s>

You're not yet three months, are you?</s>Not yet. What do you know about it?</s>I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?</s>Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.</s>But you don't look very happy.</s>*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.</s>Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.</s>
Look, are you coming or not?</s>Yes, of course.</s>Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.</s>Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.</s>

Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?</s>Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.</s>
Uh, hi Su-Chin.</s>Oh, hi Juno. How are you?</s>Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?</s>No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.</s>You should try Adderall.</s>No thanks. I'm off pills.</s>Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"</s>I heard that was you.</s>Well, it was nice seeing you.</s>
Yeah? What three words, Harry?</s>Pick 'n' Save.</s>Hm?</s>You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.</s>

You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:</s>In other words, push this red button.</s>
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?</s>Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.</s>We stick in each others craw.</s>Yes, but why?</s>Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.</s>

Wait.</s>What is it?</s>I have to pee.</s>Can't you hold it?</s>Can't you?</s>
She is Lana Turner.</s>What?</s>She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.</s>
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.</s>Well, I hope you don't expect more.</s>I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.</s>Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.</s>
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.</s>Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.</s>
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...</s>Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.</s>
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.</s>Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.</s>Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.</s>Goodbye, Bill.</s>
Do you always sleep with him?</s>I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.</s>I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?</s>
Mama let me help you.</s>NO!...She wanted me to do it.</s>
We are both from Prague.</s>How long are you planning to stay?</s>Two weeks.</s>I'd like to speak for himself, okay?</s>He doesn't speak English.</s>
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.</s>I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.</s>Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.</s>He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.</s>Tommy.  Come on. Relax.</s>Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.</s>
Here, let me do that.</s>No, I'm fine.</s>
What an interface!</s>Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.</s>Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?</s>C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.</s>Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.</s>But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.</s>

We can live with that.</s>I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.</s>
Do you think you're alone?</s>What?</s>Do you have a soul-mate?</s>Define that.</s>Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.</s>Yeah.</s>
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?</s>No.  But I'm open to distractions.</s>I'm sure you are.</s>
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?</s>Me. Hit me!</s>
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?</s>Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!</s>My son Magua's pain is my pain.</s>Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?</s>Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...</s>Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.</s>
Mirtha, how are you doing?</s>Better than you.</s>
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.</s>No, I told you...</s>
Thank you.</s>Sid, this is detective Kincaid.</s>

You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?</s>No.</s>
Are you satisfied now?</s>No.</s>
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.</s>Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?</s>
He's afraid of something.</s>He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.</s>You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?</s>
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.</s>Any reply from them?</s>

And this Butterfield guy--</s>--vanished.</s>Another fucking magician. Jesus.</s>
God...</s>What?</s>I used to eat there... Really good noodles.</s>
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.</s>You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.</s>
She still talking to you?</s>We're in love.</s>Sure.</s>No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.</s>Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --</s>Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.</s>
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.</s>How would you kill him?</s>I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.</s>
We don't like Razinin.</s>We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?</s>
What are you going to do?</s>Finish what my son started.</s>But you’ll never get away with it.</s>Enter Cotton Weary.</s>

You're Walker, right?</s>Yes Sir.</s>That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.</s>You liked that?</s>Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.</s>Sir?</s>I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.</s>Hale-what?</s>You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.</s>Sir, I --</s>Too late for apologies, Walker.</s>I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.</s>
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!</s>God dammit, Stifler!</s>Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.</s>
Professor Tripp.</s>Chancellor.</s>I got the message you called.</s>I got the message you called too.</s>
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?</s>I didn't touch him, he just passed out.</s>
Listen man, I think I have a problem.</s>We all have problems.</s>I'm pissin' fire man.</s>
Well! Nothing like experimenting.</s>I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.</s>
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?</s>I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!</s>
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.</s>And the Germans can't match it?</s>
Why tell me this?</s>The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.</s>You trust me?</s>I'll pay you.</s>
He went to pick up lunch.</s>Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.</s>Yes, sir.</s>
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.</s>He had a pressing engagement.</s>Philistine.</s>

Be quiet.</s>Where've you been?</s>Never mind that, where are we now.</s>We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?</s>Gimme a minute.</s>Looks like you can have all you want.</s>
He's gone.</s>He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.</s>
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?</s>No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...</s>Hey, can I borrow this?</s>What? Why?</s>I promise I'll take good care of it.</s>I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --</s>Don't you trust me, Seymour?</s>
Is he supposed to look like that?</s>No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...</s>
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?</s>Ich weiss alles.</s>Wie hat er's gemacht?</s>Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...</s>
What was it for?							   *</s>A load of amphetamine I told him I had.</s>
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.</s>You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?</s>
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?</s>It's his way.</s>
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?</s>It's fine today, Robert.</s>Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.</s>
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?</s>You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.</s>Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.</s>
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.</s>Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.</s>
What's his name again?</s>Campaign manager? Waldrip.</s>
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?</s>I don't let him.  He just loves to.</s>
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.</s>What are they doing here?</s>
Jack?</s>Marcie?</s>Hey, guys!</s>
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.</s>The line's over there.</s>Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?</s>How is it you're good? You on a list?</s>Yeah. Ricky Slade.</s>You see a Ricky Slade?</s>
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.</s>Yeah. I don't know.</s>You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.</s>I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.</s>
Daddy!  Come on, a name.</s>Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.</s>
You miss the pain?</s>...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.</s>Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?</s>Sure.</s>
Shit, he's puking on my feet!</s>Well, you p-puked on his feet.</s>Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!</s>
What's happening?</s>Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!</s>
We're screwed.</s>I'm well aware of that.</s>
It's Friday....</s>Do I give a shit?</s>
What?</s>She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled</s>I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...</s>
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.</s>So let's go. This place creeps me out.</s>
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.</s>I'll watch for him, sir.</s>
Do you have any brothers?</s>No, no brothers, no sisters.</s>Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?</s>
No.  I'm just a little tired.</s>Then why don't you go to sleep?</s>I can't.  I have too much to do.</s>Dad?</s>Yes?</s>Do you like this hotel?</s>
What about Larry --</s>Forget him.</s>
Alleged killer.</s>What does this matter to you?</s>You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.</s>I should release Corbett because you want some votes?</s>This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.</s>Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.</s>
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?</s>No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!</s>He's already angry, I don't think --</s>Just because he doesn't like Americans!</s>
What?!</s>He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?</s>
Yeah, I guess.</s>She plays the clarinet, too.</s>
So what about kids?</s>Kids? What about them?</s>Do you want them?</s>Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.</s>Why is that?</s>I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.</s>
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.</s>Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.</s>That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.</s>
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.</s>Bump?</s>When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.</s>
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.</s>But I'm going to have to take some stitches.</s>How many?</s>Ten.</s>
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.</s>Do you still ride?</s>Not for years.</s>So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?</s>Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?</s>
What?</s>X...</s>

Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!</s>Nothing we can do, now.</s>
With... with Annie, of course.</s>Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?</s>Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.</s>You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?</s>I'm sure.</s>Seven o'clock then.</s>Maybe.</s>
Who have we got?</s>We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.</s>You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.</s>Admittance form is wrong.</s>Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.</s>I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...</s>...Gruber's not bad.</s>Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?</s>No.</s>'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.</s>Right.</s>Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.</s>Right.</s>Brindisi versus Electric Boat.</s>You got a good memory, Franky.</s>I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...</s>
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--</s>The human?</s>Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.</s>
Yeah, he told me.</s>Personally?</s>Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.</s>What Get Away jet?</s>It was in the Herald.</s>Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.</s>Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.</s>
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.</s>What time is it?</s>Nine o'clock.</s>At night?</s>Yeah. At night.</s>How many pounds I gotta lose?</s>Three more, I figure.</s>Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.</s>I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.</s>Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.</s>
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...</s>Peugot convertible ...</s>What color?</s>Gray.</s>
Where you going?</s>Me and Wes are just going to talk.</s>Why you got to move away to talk!?</s>We're going to be right over here.</s>You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!</s>I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!</s>
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.</s>He's right, Les.</s>
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.</s>In a word? Lucrative.</s>The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.</s>Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.</s>You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?</s>What?</s>Never to put you in my will.</s>Really? Why?</s>
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.</s>I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.</s>Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.</s>
Uh-huh. Good.</s>But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...</s>And how are things going down there?</s>
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?</s>Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.</s>
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.</s>Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.</s>
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.</s>You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.</s>Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.</s>Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?</s>
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.</s>Get the fuck outta here!</s>I'm a married man.</s>Get the fuck outta here!</s>Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?</s>
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.</s>With Robert Redford, when he was young.</s>Yeah...</s>
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.</s>Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.</s>
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.</s>Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.</s>
Bottle-count.</s>Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?</s>
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.</s>It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?</s>Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.</s>
I'd love to get in there.</s>Don't we have enough already?</s>It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?</s>And suppose a little old lady lives there?</s>No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.</s>Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.</s>Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.</s>
You wanted to see me!</s>You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!</s>Why are you suddenly so mad at me?</s>Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.</s>I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.</s>You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!</s>No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--</s>I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!</s>All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--</s>
Yes, yes, I understand.</s>Good.</s>
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?</s>No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.</s>No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?</s>Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.</s>Like what?</s>Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.</s>I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?</s>I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.</s>Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.</s>
George! What are you doing here?</s>Just get in the van, Josie.</s>
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."</s>It is a nice piece of writing.</s>"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!</s>Oh, that's the best part.</s>
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.</s>What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?</s>The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.</s>
What's that?</s>You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.</s>
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.</s><u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.</s>
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.</s>You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.</s>Roll 'em.</s>Action! The scene starts.</s>
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...</s>YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!</s>

I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.</s>Look, bomb...</s>

Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.</s>Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.</s>

You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.</s>I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.</s>
What do you know about the Highlands?</s>I am a blank sheet.</s>Do you hunt?</s>Occasionally.</s>Dare say you can be taught.</s>To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.</s>If you hunt, you kill.</s>

Myself and Mr. Pink?</s>You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?</s>When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.</s>

Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...</s>Still lashed to the mast.</s>He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.</s>Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?</s>Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...</s>Maybe...?</s>Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.

The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.</s>And, what 'prize' do you see?

And now, you must face Darth Vader again!</s>I can't kill my own father.</s>Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.</s>Yoda spoke of another.</s>The other he spoke of is your twin sister.</s>But I have no sister.</s>Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.</s>Leia! Leia's my sister.</s>Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.</s>

Miles.</s>Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.</s>How's the trip?</s>Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?</s>Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.</s>And?</s>And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.</s>Huh.</s>I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.</s>
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.</s>Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.</s>

How could you call him?</s>It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story.

You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.</s>Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.</s>
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?</s>No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.</s>

But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.</s>
Yeah.</s>What's your twenty?</s>Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...</s>Turn around.</s>We know these people...!</s>Grieve elsewhere.</s>
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?</s>It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path.

What do you think I am -- a crook?</s>Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?</s>All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?</s>No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.</s>
Why not?</s>Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --</s>And I don't want to invade your privacy --</s>
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.</s>That's good enough.</s>

The voltage looks fine.</s>Then check the connections.</s>
There is something evil about her.</s>Oh, now —— now look here ——</s>I know all you are going to say —-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind.

Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...</s>Come here.</s>
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.</s>What did it look like?</s>It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.</s>
I promise, Jack...</s>Promise me again...</s>I promise. Come to bed, honey.</s>
I can take care of myself.</s>Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?</s>It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.</s>Then why are you here?</s>For the same reason you are.</s>Oh, you mean the thrill!</s>The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.</s>

I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!</s>Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.</s>But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!</s>They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.</s>I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...</s>The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.</s>
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?</s>And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.</s>
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.</s>I know.</s>So tell me you're okay, then.</s>I'm okay.</s>Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.</s>
M'mmm.</s>I just have time to get the, uh-</s>

Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!

Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.</s>The other ones?</s>The other one like you...</s>You lost me.</s>C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.</s>
It's not like her.</s>Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.</s>Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?</s>Good.  Let's get dry.</s>
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?</s>I don't know.</s>

Yes, sir.</s>If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...</s>
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.</s>Figured what out?</s>Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.</s>I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.</s>
That's the original.  There are no copies.</s>Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.</s>
Fuck you.</s>Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.</s>I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?</s>
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...</s>Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.</s>
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.</s>You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?</s>Huh? Oh. Son of Fury.

Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...</s>We have two kids, Annie and Josh...</s>
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson.

Of course, John.</s>Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.</s>The usual ten per cent?</s>Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?</s>How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.</s>... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...</s>

How would you like to have a baby, Duff?</s>Huh?</s>Don't look so scared.</s>You jivin' me?</s>Well, I haven't come around.</s>

I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.</s>Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods.

Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"</s>Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.</s>You're lucky I am not wasting you.</s>Well, little fella, let me put it this way.

I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.

Sit down, Lou.</s>
Dad -- what you doing here?</s>It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.</s>
I told the truth!</s>Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.</s>

You don't mind?</s>Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.</s>We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.</s>A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.</s>Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.</s>It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.</s>Yes, I suppose so.

Nice guy.  Who's he?</s>Who's it, you mean.</s>
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.

I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff.

He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.</s>

I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.</s>And he still sits there?</s>Every day.</s>Maybe he thinks it'll come back.</s>No.  He knows it won't.

Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?</s>As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.

A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children.

I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.</s>
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go.

When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?</s>Yes you are.</s>What was the color of Tim's belt?</s>The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.</s>Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?</s>Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.</s>Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee.

He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.

You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?</s>

Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --</s>Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --</s>I'm telling you what I have to do.

Thousand bucks ain't shit.</s>If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.</s>Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal.

What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?</s>I see the help -- judgement call.</s>Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."</s>What's wrong with your son, anyway?</s>What do you care?</s>
Does he have to be here in our hair?</s>Why, has he bothered you before?</s>Is it news to you?</s>Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.</s>Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --</s>Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!</s>Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?</s>
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.</s>A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.</s>I thought I'd take some now.</s>What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.</s>Oh?  What's the problem?</s>I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.</s>Tell you what?</s>When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?</s>What problem?</s>Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?</s>I guess.</s>Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.</s>Why not?</s>Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.</s>
Why is that funny?</s>It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.</s>Was he right?</s>
Where... where are my clothes?</s>Those are your clothes, silly.</s>
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.</s>And if you ditch us we get zilch.</s>Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.</s>

Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.</s>Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.</s>But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.</s>Well then why'd it happen?</s>I don't know. I don't fucking know.</s>
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.</s>All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.</s>I'm all ears.</s>We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.</s>
Neo, how did you do that?</s>Do what?</s>You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.</s>It wasn't fast enough.</s>
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.</s>For what?</s>For defending my honor this afternoon.</s>I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.</s>But you was going to fight for me.</s>I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.</s>He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.</s>Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.</s>That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.</s>How old are you?</s>Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.</s>No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--</s>

So what are you going to do with your share?</s>Oh, I don't care about the money.</s>Four billion dollars.</s>Seen one billion, seen them all.</s>That's because you grew up rich.</s>A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.</s>
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...</s>I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.</s>Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.</s>
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.</s>Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.</s>
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?</s>No, my lord.</s>What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?</s>Yes, my lord.</s>And, is that a pitchfork beside him?</s>Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.</s>
Here, I didn't get any.</s>Here, have some.</s>

I'm not hungry.</s>Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.</s>

How'd you get this from her?</s>You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...</s>A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?</s>No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.</s>I wish I knew.  You did good work...</s>Make eye contact when you say that.</s>I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...</s>Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.</s>
But you said you liked men to use their hands.</s>No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.</s>
It's twenty after one.</s>I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.</s>I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?</s>
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...</s>It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.</s>
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.</s>At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.</s>I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.</s>Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?

I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!</s>Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!</s>
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?</s>I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.</s>I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.</s>No, I'm fascinated.</s>Why were you suspended?</s>I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.</s>So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?</s>Well, that was plan A.</s>What's plan B?</s>Plan B is your dad.</s>What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?</s>He said he'd sponsor me.</s>Ha! And what do you have to do for him?</s>Nothing.</s>Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.</s>He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.</s>What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.</s>Sheila, please.</s>Come on Theo, what about plan C?</s>What's plan C?</s>Plan C...  ...is me.</s>
Well... yes, quite possibly.</s>Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?</s>Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--</s>Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?</s>
There's a better place for us to eat.</s>Did something happen; are you alright?</s>Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.</s>

Are you sure, Dear?</s>Come on.</s>
My work keeps me young.</s>Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?</s>The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.</s>Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.</s>We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.</s>Noriega is a criminal.</s>Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.</s>Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.</s>I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.</s>If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.</s>

Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.</s>We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.</s>

You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.

This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.</s>I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.</s>No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.</s>So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.</s>All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.</s>

But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.</s>You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.</s>I might not be able to.</s>It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...</s>
I'm sorry.</s>All right, darling.</s>
Hey, now wait a sec...</s>Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."</s>I think you'd better leave now.</s>You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!</s>You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.</s>You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.</s>

Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note.

I can't believe you did that.</s>I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.</s>It was my fucking television.</s>Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?</s>

Umm, that also has already happened.</s>Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!</s>

Just a minute –– just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!</s>I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.</s>I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!</s>
I'm fine.</s>Okay, good, this is all very noble.</s>

Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.</s>
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...</s>And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...</s>You never used to do that!</s>
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...</s>Just answer the damn phone.</s>I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.</s>

Do you believe this shit?</s>What happened?</s>
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?</s>Uh, yeah.</s>Good.   I have a job for you in America.</s>

Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.</s>No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.</s>Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.</s>Not as bad as it looks.</s>There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.</s>Wouldn't know anything about it.</s>That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.</s>Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.</s>Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.</s>Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.</s>

You --  -- are in for a surprise.</s>Am I?</s>Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...</s>Did you do any of that?</s>No, but I hear it's terrible.

That's right.</s>You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.</s>Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.</s>I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.</s>
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...</s>Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...</s>

Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.</s>
So we'll...radiate some more?</s>At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.</s>

She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body.

Tripp!</s>How are you, Crabtree?</s>Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...</s>
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.</s>Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.</s>

It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend.

But not the way they tnought.</s>

It doesn't seem to be too long.</s>Forty-one pages.</s>
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.</s>C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.</s>

All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.</s>So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.</s>
Then this is our chance.</s>Our chance to do what?</s>I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same.

Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock.

At this size, I would certainly think so.</s>If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.

Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.</s>You know what I mean.</s>I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints.

I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.

Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.</s>So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers.

One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.</s>

I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?</s>I haven't had a chance to think.

For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.</s>Let's go in the other room...</s>

It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..</s>Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.</s>
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.</s>I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.</s>Don't think I can't persuade her.</s>I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.

I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.

It's over.  We have to give up.</s>Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.</s>That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!</s>
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.</s>WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!</s>
And you're too young.</s>I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.</s>And the same age Web was. No.</s>
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.</s>Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.</s>
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.</s>How much?</s>Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.</s>
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?</s>I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.</s>
No!  We must do this alone.</s>Do what?!  George-- ?!</s>
They came all the way from Tarzana.</s>It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.</s>
Is that it?  Is this right?</s>Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.</s>All right.  Do it!</s>
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?</s>I don't see that at all ..</s>
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.</s>I know.  God go with you.</s>
Sustained.</s>Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?</s>
...I thought you were dead. Going home?</s>No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.</s>Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?</s>Meurice...</s>
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...</s>What are you gonna talk about?</s>Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...</s>Then why are you putting on mascara?</s>I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.</s>But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...</s>Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...</s>Or blush.  You look pale.</s>
Not yet...how much further is it?</s>Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.</s>
What did you call me, Mayo?</s>Zack, don't!</s>
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.</s>A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.</s>
Hello.</s>Hello.</s>
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?</s>Well...  I declared war!</s>Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...</s>
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --</s>-- did you understand me when I said that --</s>-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.</s>Goodbye.</s>

-- And I'm in love with your daughter.</s>Say again?</s>I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.</s>
Why are you speaking?</s>Excuse me?</s>You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.</s>I see.  How much?</s>Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.</s>
You did kill those men.</s>Not all of them.</s>When you finish, what then?</s>I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.</s>You make it all sound so simple.</s>The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.</s>You want me to front for you.</s>The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.</s>
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?</s>These guys are getting on my nerves.</s>
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!</s>It was an act of God for Christ's sake.</s>

They must've taken it off me.</s>They?</s>The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.</s>
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.</s>What did he mean by Huxley?</s>
I...</s>I can't really remember.</s>You can't remember.</s>
Now what?</s>I've never met anyone like you.</s>
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.</s>Been on many planes that blew up, have you?</s>
Uh... dudes?</s>Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.</s>DUDES!</s>
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.</s>Dad, please.</s>Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.</s>Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?</s>You're way ahead of me again?</s>It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.</s>The lesson being?</s>Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.</s>I'm getting so good at this.</s>
Maybe I better start working on him.</s>You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...</s>
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.</s>No one will come any nearer than that.</s>
Well... it started with the play before this one...</s>'Remembrance'.</s>
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.</s>Fuck it. Everything must go!</s>Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...</s>
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?</s>We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.</s>
Daddy!</s>Oh God!</s>You're hurting me!</s>Stop!!!!</s>Daddy. Let go.</s>What do you want from me?</s>LET GO!</s>
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?</s>It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.</s>I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?</s>I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.</s>As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --</s>Yes, Sister?</s>Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.</s>
How many times have you seen Frank?</s>Four times... so far.</s>Can anyone else see him?</s>I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.</s>Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?</s>I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.</s>A sign from whom?</s>I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.</s>How does that make you feel?</s>It reminded me of my dog Callie.</s>Is Callie still around?</s>No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...</s>Do you feel alone right now?</s>
You wouldn't have done that?</s>Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.</s>I want them arrested and hanged!</s>Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.</s>This is no game.</s>I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.</s>
My wife, Mr. Creasy.</s>Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.</s>
Are you two okay?</s>We've been better.</s>What's going on?</s>Michael Myers.</s>Who's that?</s>10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.</s>
How about it, Ma?</s>I'm ready.</s>
Sorry.  We were saying?</s>You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?</s>Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.</s>
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.</s>We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.</s>Yes?</s>And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.</s>Why me?</s>Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?</s>...very good.</s>Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.</s>...why?</s>Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...</s>You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?</s>Now, whyn't you help us?</s>That would adversely impact my income.</s>Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.</s>We could skip the Gavotte.</s>Say it in English.</s>Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?</s>Then who's buying it?</s>There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you...</s><u>That's</u> the spirit...</s>...aren't you afraid of me...?</s>You want me to be?</s>I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.</s>
You all right, Professor Tripp?</s>He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.</s>Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.</s>Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.</s>Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.</s>
I'd better collect my family first.</s>Oh...</s>
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.</s>Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.</s>
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.</s>Mio fratello.</s>
Drink up, it's party time.</s>Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?</s>Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.</s>

We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!</s>Okay, Lovey.</s>And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!</s>They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.</s>Horns?</s>
Disappointed?</s>About what?</s>About not finding any bogey men?</s>I'll get over it.</s>
Here, I got it.</s>No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.</s>
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.</s>Sleeping.</s>Rise and shine.</s>No please, let me sit this one out.</s>Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.</s>I resign.</s>Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.</s>Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.</s>Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?</s>Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.</s>
How hot are they?</s>Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.</s>
Tell them to get something to eat.</s>I thought we were poor.</s>Not that poor.</s>

Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.</s>She still work there?</s>No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.</s>Was there ever any kind of investigation...</s>
I came up here to sneak a smoke.</s>You were smoking?</s>I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.</s>Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.</s>
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.</s>Names.</s>

I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...</s>And when was that?</s>Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...</s>Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...</s>No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...</s>
You can't take her away from here!</s>Why not?</s>Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.</s>What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?</s>She came here in 1888!</s>
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?</s>I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.</s>
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.</s>I'll be fine.</s>She said convincingly.</s>
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.</s>I'd wish for a puppy.</s>One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?</s>I only want one.</s>A foolish wish. And you, Quell?</s>
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?</s>Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.</s>Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.</s>Honey.</s>
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.</s>The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?</s>
You don't even know me.</s>I have the rest of my life to find out.</s>
One hunnert's the best we can do here.</s>Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.</s>
How are we doing?</s>I think everything's ready.</s>Good.  I'll start bringing things in.</s>

Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?</s>I don't know, Brian... I don't know...</s>
You're welcome.</s>Peace out.</s>
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --</s>You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --</s>I don't want to be just your friend --</s>You don't know what you want --</s>You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --</s>And why would that scare me?</s>Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.</s>
We understand.</s>All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.</s>
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?</s>Should we get a what?</s>points at the motel.</s>Oh.</s>
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?</s>Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...</s>
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.</s>I think I can top that, Mister...</s>
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.</s>She didn't look Italian to me.</s>
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.</s>Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?</s>A sight for sore eyes!</s>Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!</s>Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!</s>
Goodbye, Grady.</s>No. Sara, you don't understand...</s>Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.</s>Yea?</s>How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.</s>

I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."</s>"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.</s>
How the hell is that your business?</s>We're just trying to figure out what happened.</s>
I don't have an Amana freezer.</s>It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.</s>Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.</s>I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.</s>
Where is Mr. Sulu?</s>Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?</s>
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.</s>Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.</s>
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.</s>I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.</s>He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.</s>
Now you're going to have to tell me more.</s>...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.</s>How so?</s>Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.</s>You and my mother would have a special connection.</s>Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.</s>...And everyone lived happily ever after.</s>
What are you talking about?</s>Don't sweet lip me.</s>I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...</s>You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.</s>Nothing happened in Vegas.</s>I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?</s>

Nice doggie. Good boy.</s>Walk away, Jack.</s>Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.</s>
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?</s>How's that?</s>What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.</s>Frank, please...</s>The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.</s>Frank, this is insane...</s>In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.</s>Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?</s>
What news from our friends?</s>Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.</s>Freylag's stronghold?</s>It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.</s>It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.</s>The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.</s>It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.</s>We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.</s>

And I don't mean Indiana.</s>What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?</s>You know goddamn well what I mean.</s>You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.</s>Well leave then. Go to Hell.</s>You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!</s>
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...</s>I don't need a crazy woman in my life.</s>Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.</s>

I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?</s>I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.</s>No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?</s>I think so.</s>You don't think it's tilted a little too much --</s>
Don't forget these.</s>Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?</s>I think they make you look sexy.</s>
One of your secrets.</s>Yes, one of many.</s>

You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.</s>We are.</s>It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.</s>Why are you here?</s>To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.</s>And what of the Enterprise?</s>I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.</s>You know that's not possible.</s>I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.</s>Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten.

We'll be back at the platform in...</s>20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.</s>20 minutes.  Susan?</s>
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.</s>Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?</s>That's what I'm trying to explain.</s>
What trip?</s>You went to Rekall, remember?</s>I did?</s>Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.</s>What are you, my father?</s>Let me buy you a drink.</s>No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.</s>

Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?</s>As per mother's instructions.</s>Do we always follow Mother's instructions?</s>For a man in my position --</s>Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.

How do you know George Cukor?</s>I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.</s>I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.</s>Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.</s>My monsters?</s>Don't go away.</s>

I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.</s>We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course.

Are you really nineteen?</s>Yes... I am really nineteen.</s>
They're not bad.</s>No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.</s>My what?</s>Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.</s>Huh.  That was nice of me.</s>You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.

In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?</s>Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution.

"I am become Death, the...</s>...destroyer of worlds."</s>No!</s>No!</s></s>You'll kill us all!</s>Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!</s>It's too...</s>
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.</s>Throw him out.</s>
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.</s>Where is she? Where is the girl?</s>She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.</s>Where does he hang out?</s>I don't know.</s>Where!</s>Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.</s>
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.</s>She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.</s>It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.</s>How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?</s>
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.</s>What?  Why?</s>
What did he say?  What did he say?</s>That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.</s>Do? To who?</s>Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.</s>
...sir...?</s>Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.</s>
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...</s>How did you settle on the amount?</s>We thought it was just.</s>You thought it was just.</s>Yes.</s>Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.</s>That was our insurance company's recommendation.</s>Yes.  It would be.</s>
It's what?</s>It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.</s>
Who's left out there?</s>Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.</s>Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.</s>
You're the doctor, what do you think?</s>She seems very unhappy.</s>
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.</s>Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?</s>As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.</s>Anything else?</s>Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.</s>Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?</s>
Start it.</s>I can't...</s>
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.</s>Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?</s>
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.</s>Why, I don't understand?</s>To begin with it could make things worse.</s>But how?</s>Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...</s>You could do it yourself...</s>No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-</s>Could you see her?</s>Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...</s>Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!</s>No, you don't understand. Your daughter-</s>Oh, will you help her! Just help her!</s>
Absolutely.</s><u>Before</u> 5:00--</s>--hours before--</s>--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--</s>--no one'll ever know.</s>
Now we're in for it.</s>The door was closed.  It must still be in here.</s>
Sorry. What are those cards?</s>Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.</s>Terrify me?</s>See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.</s>
Goodnight, honey.</s>Don't I get a kiss?</s>I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...</s>We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.</s>It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?</s>We can be real quiet...</s>I love that you're my wife.</s>You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...</s>You bring me such peace...</s>Oohhhh, Eugene!</s>Shhhh..</s>Oooohhhh.</s>Don't wake the kids...</s>Ooohhhh!</s>
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.</s>What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.</s>
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?</s>Hey, Joe!</s>Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?</s>Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!</s>
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.</s>Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.</s>And?</s>And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.</s>He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.</s>He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.</s>Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.</s>I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.</s>
Who wrote it?</s>But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.</s>You don't know, do you?</s>And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.</s>The park?</s>Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.</s>Who wrote it?</s>Roald Dahl.</s>Roald Dahl. Fuck me.</s>
Come, it'll help you sleep.</s>Aye. But it won't let me dream.</s>
Think this is our guy?</s>I don't know. It looks familiar to me.</s>Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.</s>
Hurry!</s>I can't do it! I can't do it!</s>
Yeah. Is it...</s>Ya catch any fish?</s>...What?</s>Ya catch any fish?</s>Yeah...</s>...What kind of fish?</s>Listen, what is it? Is it done?</s>
Help me, Grace, help...</s>Like you helped her, Jake?</s>
You didn't answer my question.</s>I know.</s>
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.</s>Like you care.</s>I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .</s>I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.</s>
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?</s>Bitch, bitch, bitch!</s>Up yours.</s>I heard that.</s>
I'll bet a dollar.</s>Me, too...</s>
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.</s>So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?</s>Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.</s>How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?</s>
She own you, Jimmy?</s>Yes.</s>She from Scotland too?</s>You could say that.</s>And you're not going to tell me more?</s>I can't.</s>
Yllo, what's your head count?</s>Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.</s>
What'd you say?</s>I said I wish I'd never been born.</s>Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.</s>
Loretta...Sidney Falco...</s>How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.</s>
Welcome to ya. What's your name?</s>Edward Bloom.</s>
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.</s>First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?</s>
You weren't expecting me?</s>No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...</s>You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.</s>
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.</s>Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.</s>
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?</s>Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --</s>You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?</s>Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...</s>A lot of people like our singing.</s>I'm sure it's lovely.</s>But you don't want to hear it.</s>No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?</s>
Hurricane kept you up, too?</s>Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.</s>
If I don't make it back here by ten...</s>Yeah?</s>... I'd head for Cucamonga.</s>
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.</s>We must sue for peace.</s>Peace?!</s>We cannot defeat this --</s>With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!</s>It is suicide.</s>
What did you tell him about the baby?</s>That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.</s>And you turned him down??</s>Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.</s>
Can't see a thing.</s>I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...</s>But you were coming up anyway, remember?</s>I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!</s>Right next to the one you already had.</s>Look, Mr. Brenner...</s>
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.</s>Says what, Kenny?</s>
Not at all!</s>We can handle it.</s>
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.</s>What post office?</s>The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.</s>
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?</s>Yes.</s>Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.</s>I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.</s>
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?</s>Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.</s>And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?</s>Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!</s>
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?</s>You could say that --</s><u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.</s>Raising money is tough.</s>Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...</s>
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?</s>I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?</s>There are still things I have to do.</s>Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?</s>Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?</s>You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.</s>No, I meant lose his family.</s>Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?</s>But times are different...</s>
You gonna go get him?</s>It's possible.  Why?</s>I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.</s>He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.</s>My little girl, the tough babe.</s>
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.</s>He's got a houseboat.</s>I hate boats.</s>It sounds nice.</s>Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.</s>Houseboats don't go anywhere.</s>Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.</s>It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.</s>But it's on the water.</s>It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.</s>I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.</s>No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.</s>
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?</s>The brachiosaur?  Thirty.</s>
What did you get?</s>I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.</s>Good.</s>
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."</s>I'm moved beyond words.</s>
Uh, hi, Eileen.</s>How are you?</s>Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --</s>
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --</s>Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?</s>
The examination is a normal function.</s>You may proceede.</s>
Hi.</s>Hi.</s>Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.</s>Yes I do.</s>
Want to join me in some cartwheels?</s>No. I feel more like - yodeling.</s>Yodeling?</s>
Now that's what I call a meal.</s>It's like the Garden of Eden...</s>
This room sucks.</s>She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.</s>Let's ditch and find them ourselves.</s>
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.</s>Okay.  ... I love you...</s>
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.</s>Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?</s>
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?</s>Well, they go to guard school.</s>To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.</s>They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.</s>
He went back for his brother.</s>We said 48 hours.</s>That's a long time to be in jail.</s>
I thought I'd find you here.</s>I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.</s>That's the one about the albatross, right?</s>We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...</s>We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.</s>Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.</s>I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.</s>We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.</s>Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.</s>
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.</s>...And you had to kill him?</s>No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.</s>You're in here for winging a guy?</s>
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.</s>Queen Harry?</s>It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.</s>
David?</s>Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.</s>
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.</s>I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...</s>
Gimme that.</s>You sure?</s>You're driving.</s>Those are Feds.</s>I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?</s>
Waddaya gonna do now?</s>I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.</s>You want me to ride down with you?</s>What for?</s>It's early.</s>It must be one o'clock.</s>It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!</s>Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.</s>
Second thing this week I can't explain.</s>What was the first thing?</s>Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.</s>Sounds like a virus.</s>No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.</s>
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?</s>'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...</s>
Let them.</s>I have something for you...</s>
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.</s>Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.</s>
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.</s>We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.</s>
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!</s>What did you do with her?</s>Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.</s>-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?</s>Was I? The driver got knocked cold.</s>
Don?</s>No.</s>Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.</s>
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.</s>You're no fool, George.  You never have been.</s>
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?</s>Difficult.  I'm difficult.</s>
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.</s>They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?</s>
No, M'lord.</s>Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!</s>
Aunt May, you're trespassing.</s>Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?</s>
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.</s>What'll I do for fun?</s>Whyn't you learn your lines?</s>I <u>know</u> my lines...</s>
Charlie!</s>I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.</s>
The world of our children. How dare they?</s>It's war. The weakest suffer the most.</s>You're American.</s>So are you.</s>
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.</s>VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...</s>
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!</s>Lafayette is a child!</s>Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.</s>
Why didn't he call himself?</s>He's in Palermo.</s>What's wrong can never be made right.</s>Let me come and talk to you.</s>
I wish to see my mother.</s>She's busy.</s>Convey her a message.</s>She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.</s>Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.</s>Are you deaf as well as stupid?</s>

You've been very cold to me tonight.</s>No.</s>Is something wrong?</s>Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.</s>
Nervous?</s>Excited.</s>
She's great. Gimme the money.</s>First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.</s>
Mornin', Doc...</s>You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...</s>
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.</s>All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.</s>
I thought that was you, up there.</s>My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...</s>
Holy shit -</s>Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?</s>Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!</s>

From Miss Johnson --</s>Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?</s>
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.</s>Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.</s>
Help Chase. I'll be back.</s>Did Two-Face call him Bruce?</s>
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.</s>Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?</s>
What are you?</s>I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?</s>
No police.</s>But, Senor--</s>No police!  Wait until I'm gone.</s>Senor, you need a doctor.</s>No police!</s>
This is monstrous!</s>Yes, and very beautiful.</s>
I *know* this was right.</s>Right.</s>
What is this?</s>I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.</s>That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?</s>
I deserve a lot worse.</s>What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.</s>
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.</s>Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.</s>She's pretty cute.</s>Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.</s>There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.</s>Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?</s>If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.</s>Yeah, no shit.</s>As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.</s>Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.</s>Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.</s>I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.</s>I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.</s>Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.</s>Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.</s>Hot has got nothing to do with it.</s>
What are you doing here?</s>Mickey told me to come back to work.</s>
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!</s>Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.</s>
You don't know the Underhills?</s>I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.</s>I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?</s>Of course.</s>
Mother! You called me by name!</s>Yes, Barbara... Barbara...</s>
Boy, are you gonna get it.</s>My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.</s>
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...</s>All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?</s>But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...</s>Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:</s>

ON THE NOSE?</s>GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.</s>
You got him involved?</s>Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.</s>
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.</s>Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.</s>
A girl of spirit.</s>She's right. It's none of my business.</s>
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.</s>We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.</s>Pardon me?</s>Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.</s>What's the profile?</s>Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?</s>You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.</s>Don't let your father's business infect your life.</s>How can you, how can you say that?</s>Because he's guilty.</s>No, no he's not.</s>We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.</s>

Me?</s>Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.</s>Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?</s>Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.</s>Tsch, what'd the doctor say?</s>Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?</s>Will it change your wife?</s>Will it change my life?</s>Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!</s>No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.</s>You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...</s>Life. I said, "life."</s>
I haven't slept in weeks.</s>Why don't you try counting sheep?</s>That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.</s>

I'm in the bridge.</s>Barnes?</s>
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?</s>...I wouldn't know.</s>

Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.</s>No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.</s>
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.</s>I'm not giving up.</s>You must.</s>
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.</s>Johnnie?</s>It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.</s>Like each other?  They hate each other.</s>Why?</s>It started way before I was around.

What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?</s>Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?</s>

Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.</s>Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.</s>

Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.</s>I see. I would like to work in your garden.</s>
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?</s>That's great.  Let's do a take.</s>
Linda King's desk.</s>Hi, Linda. ..</s>Linda doesn't come in nights.</s>Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone.

This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?</s>I guess so.</s>
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.</s>Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.</s>

I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.</s>I don't remember that.</s>I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.</s>That's ridiculous.</s>What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.</s>

Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -</s>That's not correct.</s>What's wrong with it?</s>The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.</s>As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.</s>I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?</s>Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -</s>Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know!

He's being real nice to me.</s>You think he's got a thing for you?</s>Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.</s>I don't follow your logic.

Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.</s>Like open an airlock by mistake?</s>Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.</s>Well I hope I don't do anything careless.</s>I'm sure you'll be all right.</s>Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.</s>Really?</s>Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.</s>

It's all coincidence.</s>What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?</s>She's real.

I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.</s>Tell us about him.</s>Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.</s>
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.</s>Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.</s>I thought I recognized the work.  Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.</s>
Yes, that would certainly do...</s>Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?</s>Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...</s>Just wait here.</s>
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?</s>Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.</s>I wish she was beneath me.</s>
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...</s>All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...</s>

They did show up.  Isn't that great?</s>I hope so.</s>

Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...</s>I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.</s>
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.</s>I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!</s>
Shit!</s>Brady! Come with us.</s>Go!</s>Brady!</s>Get up there Rachel!</s>
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?</s>And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.</s>The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?</s>What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?</s>All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.</s>
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!</s>Your Majesty --</s>Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.</s>
I caught one, back there.</s>Caught one?  You mean you got shot?</s>

Aramis, this will never --</s>Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.</s>But --</s>It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!</s>
I'd given you up.</s>Sorry.</s>
Did you send the car?</s>It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.</s>
Will you work for me?</s>Of course... But how?</s>How what, Wendell?</s>How'd you get them to retract?</s>
Chief - mind if I take her?</s>Okay.  But not water sports.</s>
I see where Palantine got the nomination.</s>Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.</s>Well, I hope he wins.</s>
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.</s>What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.</s>Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.</s>Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.</s>Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?</s>
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!</s>So is the town, I notice!</s>I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.</s>I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.</s>

Geez mom.</s>It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...</s>
I see you bought some napkins.</s>Might as well go all the way.</s>
So, you live around here.</s>Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.</s>
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter</s>Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.</s>Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?</s>Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.</s>
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.</s>What happened to your money?</s>Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.</s>Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?</s>I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.</s>
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?</s>Yes.</s>Are your parents living?</s>Why, no.</s>Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?</s>Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.</s>Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.</s>He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—</s>
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --</s>Excuse me.</s>Yes...?</s>Don't I know you?</s>I don't believe so.</s>Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.</s>No, my dear. You must be mistaken.</s>Oh bullshit.</s>
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?</s>The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!</s>
The £1,000 is on account.</s>My rates...</s>We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.</s>Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?</s>Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.</s>
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...</s>... How long?</s>Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.</s>It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.</s>I don't understand.</s>Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.</s>I still don't...</s>
You made it up.</s>Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.</s>
Oooooh, I'm good.</s>Hey, you guys back already?</s>
Then it don't work.</s>What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?</s>
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.</s>What hump?</s>
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.</s>Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?</s>I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.</s>
Aren't you going to join us?</s>I have to finish this for class.</s>You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.</s>You mean as opposed to your life?</s>
Jesse, we got to have a word.</s>Sure, cousin.</s>All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."</s>Yep.</s>Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.</s>

Is it dead?</s>Yeah.</s>
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.</s>I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...</s>
Kevin?  Do you not love me?</s>No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.</s>But you don't love me.</s>I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."</s>
That ought to be about the end of that.</s>Yup.</s>
I got an award once. From the Mayor.</s>Congratulations.</s>Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.</s>You use needles?</s>No.</s>Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?</s>No.</s>That's good.</s>

I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!</s>You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?</s>Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!</s>
This is your house.</s>I know.</s>
I should talk this over with your husband.</s>Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.</s>Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.</s>
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?</s>Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?</s>I think that you know.</s>Maybe...I don't...</s>
Not much luggage.</s>I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.</s>How grateful?</s>Well that depends.</s>On what.</s>How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?</s>How I usually find you, Nyah.</s>How do you that.</s>Magic...</s>Ahh..</s>
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.</s>You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?</s>Happy for him.  And relieved.</s>So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?</s>
To do my work well, I have little time for --</s>You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?</s>I usually take lunch by the River.</s>It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.</s>I did not realize it was obligatory.</s>Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?</s>No, sir.</s>Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.</s>Well, I --</s>Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?</s>-- Eduard --</s>-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.</s>
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.</s>You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.</s>
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?</s>Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.</s>Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?</s>
It just ain't happening --</s>You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -</s>What's that?</s>
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --</s>Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?</s>
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.</s>I could of... easy.</s>Yeah, I guess so.</s>Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.</s>Maybe I ain't.</s>Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.</s>
Guess I'll just keep working.</s>What're you crazy?</s>I like my job.</s>
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --</s>Murder.</s>-- there is a serious question as to whether --</s>These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.</s>I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.</s>All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.</s>Get out.</s>Your control over your children, therefore --</s>Did you hear me?!</s>You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.</s>If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.</s>
Merde! Just missed!</s>Uhh! Would you die already!</s>
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?</s>Yes, your honor.</s>I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?</s>I do not, your honor, however--</s>This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.</s>Does the witness deny the injury took place?</s>No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.</s>Then I have concluded my questions.</s>
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.</s>Would you?</s>
McCall, you all right?</s>I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...</s>Stay put.</s>
Hello, Mulvaney here...</s>Sal, get 'em in the vault.</s>
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?</s>Where is it?</s>On that chair in the hall.</s>
You called me your girl?</s>What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.</s>I think you were jealous</s>Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?</s>
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.</s>Well, I'll get it from the safe.</s>I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --</s>-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.</s>I'm awfully sorry.</s>
Yakuza.</s>Good.  Very good...</s>
It's not getting any longer.</s>Longer?  It's getting shorter.</s>
Visualize a spare?</s>Well you know what I mean.</s>So, what's on your mind?</s>Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?</s>You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.</s>No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.</s>
So whenever we want...</s>Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.</s>So you're our own private guy?</s>I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.</s>You know my pager number?</s>No. What is it?</s>I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?</s>The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.</s>
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...</s>Do you really think so?</s>
I think you're drunk.</s>Just drunk enough.</s>
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?</s>What are you doing?</s>You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.</s>
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.</s>I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.</s>I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.</s>I don't believe it.</s>I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.</s>
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?</s>He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.</s>
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--</s>With your gun?...</s>
If I were you -</s>- You're not.</s>Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.</s>Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."</s>
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.</s>Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?</s>
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!</s>Don't speak Russian!</s>Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?</s>Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!</s>
You used the wrong test.</s>Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.</s>
I advise you to let us go.</s>You advise us!</s>You're out numbered son.</s>
Your breasts feel larger.</s>They do? Oh no...</s>No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.</s>
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.</s>So we'll get egg nog.</s>
You're fired.</s>Fine...</s>
Ted...?</s>I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.</s>But I think I'd be happiest... with you.</s>
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.</s>But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!</s>Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.</s>
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.</s>I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.</s>
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.</s>Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.</s>I didn't say he was alive.</s>
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.</s>What??</s>
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.</s>Oh, yeah, sure.</s>
Where'd he come from?</s>I don't know. He just appeared as magic.</s>Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.</s>
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.</s>I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.</s>I guess not.</s>I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.</s>Roger.</s>
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!</s>Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!</s>
Wasn't it, ladies?</s>Are you talking to us?</s>
Hello there.</s>What are you doing here?</s>Exercising my visitation rights.</s>Since when?</s>I miss my kids.</s>They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.</s>
Honey!</s>She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.</s>
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.</s>Please, except my humblest apologies...</s>Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?</s>

Holy shit! Holy shit.</s>What is it?</s>
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?</s>May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.</s>He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.</s>I swear it will be done.</s>
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.</s>That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.</s>
Monsieur Rick, I --</s>-- He's just a lucky guy.</s>
That's right.</s>Isn't it a little late?</s>Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?</s>
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.</s>This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.</s>
Is your back still killing you?</s>I didn't think you'd come today.</s>I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.</s>No.  Mostly me.</s>Peter left me yesterday.</s>Left you?</s>No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'</s>What did he say?</s>'I'll be in the bedroom.'</s>
Christ...no time...</s>There never is.</s>
How's school?</s>OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...</s>Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.</s>Why? What do you mean?</s>Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?</s>
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?</s>No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.</s>Why would he do that?</s>To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.</s>Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"</s>I won't talk first.</s>
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.</s>You mean he's not a criminal?</s>
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.</s>Huh?</s>
Yes.</s>What an odd pairing.</s>It's just a saying, Mr. Black,</s>Of whom?</s>It doesn't matter.</s>Then why did you bring it up?</s>
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!</s>Starck...</s>
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!</s>Yes.</s>
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time</s>No - I've been abroad for a long time...</s>
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.</s>Ahh.</s>
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?</s>Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.</s>Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?</s>Yes.</s>I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.</s>
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?</s>My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.</s>
Maybe he showed me something.</s>Try to think what it was.</s>
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?</s>If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.</s>Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.</s>So why play into his hands? We can protect you.</s>Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.</s>
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.</s>That's all right.</s>
What do you mean?</s>I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.</s>I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???</s>
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...</s>No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...</s>I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.</s>
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?</s>Yeah, sure.</s>
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.</s>The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.</s>I think America suits you.</s>
That was close...</s>What did these Vancouver factories do?</s>
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?</s>You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.</s>I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--</s>--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.</s>They asked who would be best suited for this and you--</s>Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!</s>
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?</s>I go to funerals.</s>
Where did you get it?</s>I. sold the car.</s>You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.</s>I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.</s>Take it back. Till you sell your book.</s>Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.</s>Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.</s>

That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.</s>Did you give Mary something called Red Death?</s>Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.</s>I should be going. I just quit.</s>Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.</s>
But eh what was the matter with him?</s>Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.</s>

Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.</s>They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.</s>

I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".</s>It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.</s>

Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.</s>I don't want him hurt...</s>
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.</s>What club?</s>Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?</s>I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...</s>
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?</s>Dad...</s>

I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.</s>Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.</s>You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.</s>Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.</s>I'd love to.</s>
I'm sure.</s>Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.</s>
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?</s>What do you think?</s>We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And the phone call to Rome...</s>

Were you attracted to me right away?</s>No.</s>When did it start?</s>Honestly?</s>Uh-huh.</s>When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.</s>Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.</s>Why?</s>That doesn't sound normal.</s>I'm not normal.</s>I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.</s>
But</s>Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...</s>
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.</s>Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!</s>Of course I haven't got a nose.</s>

Jesus God...</s>What is it?</s>
You think because you represent the former Duchess...</s>The Duchess...</s>The former Duchess!</s>In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...</s>

Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.</s>At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.</s>Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!</s>What's the matter?</s>I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?</s>I don't trust that chatterbox.</s>

Eddie, what's in that case?</s>Haven't you opened it?</s>No, why should I? It's yours.</s>It's a machine gun.

What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.</s>But that's just not reality, Nancy!</s>
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.</s>Many of the thieves will resist.

All he have to do is ask somebody.</s>Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!</s>Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.</s>NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?</s>He ask, I give him anything.</s>Why's that necessary all of a sudden?</s>I don't know him that well.</s>You know he's colored?

Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --</s>There!</s>What?</s>Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.</s>Him?</s>I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.</s>There isn't any.</s>There's no risk?</s>
Let's talk some more first.</s>Right.  So!  In town on business?</s>Uh-huh.</s>Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.</s>And why do you say that?</s>I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.</s>
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.</s>We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.</s>This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.</s>Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?</s>We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.</s>How?</s>First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?</s>
What'd you say to him?</s>To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.</s>What does Norman already know?</s>Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.</s>
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...</s>Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.</s>Tell it to the ones that did this to me.</s>
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?</s>He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!</s>
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.</s>The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.</s>

What's this?</s>That's a lucky C note for our new deal.</s>
I'm getting experience.</s>You watch yourself!</s>
Andy, the theater's that way!</s>Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."</s>
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..</s>Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?</s>Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.</s>
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.</s>What do you mean?</s>
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?</s>Hey buddy. You okay ?</s>Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.</s>
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!</s>You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.</s>
Yes.</s>I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?</s>
Your bookie?</s>No.</s>I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.</s>Actually, she's silver-haired.</s>Not...gray.</s>Not really, no.</s>
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...</s>Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.</s>What?</s>Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.</s>If you actually have news from Manchester then...</s>Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.</s>Preysing, you're joking with us.</s>
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.</s>No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.</s>
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?</s>I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.</s>No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.</s>
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...</s>Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...</s>
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.</s>No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.</s>Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.</s>Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.</s>It is only important what you are. An adulterer...</s>I am the Lord's voice in this town.</s>Wallowing in sin and lust...</s>They need guidance.</s>Wallowing quite literally in blood.</s>Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!</s>He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.</s>
Come off it, Bugs.</s>Come off it, Bugs.</s>Ben-jamin.</s>

How is he?</s>Nice.</s>Arterial silk.</s>
I'm here for you, Doc.</s>Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?</s>I guess that makes sense.</s>Yes, yes it does...</s>
Toh-pak-cha=8A</s>HoS qorDu.</s>
Listen, Arlo.</s></s>Hey!</s>
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?</s>They're yellow.</s>Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.</s>Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.</s>I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...</s>Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.</s>What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."</s>Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?</s>You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.</s>I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.</s>And I disagree.</s>
Where did you get this power?</s>The power was within you.</s>I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?</s>Join my quest.</s>What is it you seek?</s>What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.</s>A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.</s>Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.</s>But how?</s>Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.</s>
Wake up, baby.</s>Whu?</s>Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!</s>
What's your new book called?</s>I don't have a title yet.</s>What's it about?</s>It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.</s>Oh, like I could do that?</s>

Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.</s>It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.</s>Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.</s>Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...</s>

It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.</s>They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.</s>

You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.</s>I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.</s>I would not presume to debate you.</s>That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.</s>Or the one.</s>

Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things.

What's the matter?</s>Give us time.</s>Like hugging a lamp post.</s>Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.</s>You were well adjusted to my being dead?</s>We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.</s>What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?</s>I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.</s>Disease?</s>Situation.</s>This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.</s>A telegram--a phone call might have helped.</s>Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.</s>Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.</s>You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?</s>Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.</s>
Darryl.</s>What?</s>Go fuck yourself.</s>
Besides, Dad would have freaked.</s>No, he wouldn't.</s>I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.</s>That's not true.</s>Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.</s>
Who are you to make assessments?</s>I'll assess all I want!</s>
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.</s>Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.</s>
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?</s>Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.</s>
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?</s>She knows stuff about me that only you know.</s>She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.</s>What was she like in school?</s>I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.</s>
You’re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don’t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn’t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.</s>You don’t say.</s>That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.</s>
Hi.</s>Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?</s>If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...</s>Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?</s>You think that's really any of your business?</s>Well, you did invite me here.</s>Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.</s>
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...</s>I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?</s>
Miss, would I be prying?</s>Everything is wrong.</s>No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?</s>Yeah, I guess so.</s>Did you and your boyfriend just break up?</s>No.</s>Are you in trouble with the law?</s>No.</s>Am I getting warm?</s>
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?</s>No.</s>Her father loading up the shotgun?</s>Stella!</s>It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.</s>She's just not the girl for me.</s>She's only perfect.</s>Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.</s>Is what you want something you can discuss?</s>
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?</s>You're certifiable.</s>You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.</s>Believe you about what?</s>
Because he's a bitch.</s>That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.</s>
The shack...</s>She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.</s>
Dinner?  Absolutely.</s>Absolutely.</s>
... Shoelaces?</s>Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.</s>Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?</s>Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.</s>Does it work on cash machines?</s>
This is very good for us.</s>It is?</s>The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.</s>As long as he keeps out of the park.</s>After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.</s>The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."</s>We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?</s>That's the XKE.</s>The what?</s>It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.</s>What kind of a life is that?</s>He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!</s>If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.</s>No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.</s>I wish Paul luck.</s>It's suicide!</s>I'd be dead by now if that were the case.</s>Meaning?</s>Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.</s>Why would you do that?</s>To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--</s>I'm amazed.</s>Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.</s>And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!</s>They didn't murder me.</s>Paul's only twelve years old.</s>He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.</s>We've got to rescue him.</s>If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.</s>He's not your son.</s>No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.</s>It's a jungle out there.</s>That's been said before.</s>He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.</s>
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.</s>For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.</s>Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.</s>
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.</s>You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?</s>Well, you'd have to keep it under control.</s>And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?</s>You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.</s>
Thank you.  I'll tell him.</s>For me?</s>Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.</s>Damn.</s>
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --</s>Don't say another word, Valerie.</s>He's afraid.

Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck</s>I'm not listening.</s>A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --</s>Nobody's hearing nothing!</s>Humperdinck. Humperdinck!

Careful...careful.</s>Shut up.</s>
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.</s>Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?</s>No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.</s>
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?</s>It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.</s>So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?</s>More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.</s>
Here you go, buddy.</s>What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.</s>The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.</s>Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.</s>
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?</s>Go right ahead, sir.</s>

Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.</s>No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...</s>

How about us? Is that the truth for us?</s>I don't know.</s>

Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.</s>I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.</s>

What -- What do we do?</s>Help me.</s>
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?</s>Good.  That's it...See you.</s>
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.</s>I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.</s>
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?</s>Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.</s>
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --</s>You and the Colonel go back.</s>He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.</s>You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.</s>It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --</s>Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.</s>Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?</s>
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.</s>Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.</s>And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?</s>That's what I'm saying.</s>
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...</s>My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...</s>

And what were you doing out at the missile silo?</s>I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.</s>Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.</s>Yes.</s>Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...</s>I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.</s>
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.</s>I'm likin' you guys better</s>

No wonder he let her go.</s>Really.</s>

He does. Could we have a table close to him?</s>And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.</s>
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.</s>It was too dark, Daddy.</s>Yeah. We better git back to house now.</s>
Let the child stay.</s>Now, I don't know Amy --</s>
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.</s>Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.</s>Sure.</s>Am I right?</s>I can see that. Sure.</s>So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.</s>You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?</s>Mm, you want to steal it?</s>No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.</s>I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.</s>Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?</s>I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.</s>I know what you mean.</s>
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.</s>It's your best play, Nicky.</s>He'll hate it.</s>He'll kill it.

Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.</s>No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.</s>

No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.</s>You're crazy --</s>You can't duck this, Bill.

Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.</s>Shhh, my head hurts.</s>I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.</s>Why did you help me?</s>It doesn't matter.</s>

Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?</s>That sounds great!</s>Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.</s>
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?</s>It could've happened to anyone.</s>I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.</s>
What's vermin again?</s>Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...</s>Nicole?</s>Yes.</s>Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?</s>Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?</s>I want to sit beside you tomorrow.</s>Okay.</s>

I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?</s>I understand.</s>I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.</s>
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.</s>Oh, sorry, right.</s>You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!</s>We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.</s>
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.</s>I will.</s>

Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.</s>Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.</s>
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?</s>Yes, I agree, I think so too.</s>To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?</s>Yes, I understand.</s>And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!</s>We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.</s>Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?</s>I certainly do.</s>Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.</s>Do you think so? Do you think so?</s>So you know Krylov!</s>
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me.

Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?</s>Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?</s>I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.</s>6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?</s>I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.</s>Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"</s>well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.</s>
You're not here.</s>Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.</s>
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.</s>That's because I don't have a doorbell.</s>
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.</s>Then look!</s>
What did you say?</s>Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.</s>
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.</s>The shit they pull, huh?</s>
And don't pass on the right.</s>Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...</s>Hey, man, why'd you say that?!</s>'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!</s>
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.</s>I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.</s>
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.</s>The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.</s>And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.</s>The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.</s>
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?</s>Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?</s>Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.</s>I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...</s>Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!</s>That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.</s>
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?</s>I don't know what you're talking about!</s>Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!</s>Part of what?</s>
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.</s>No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.</s>I'm still scared.</s>
Please, mom. People will talk.</s>I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.</s>Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?</s>Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.</s>Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?</s>
He says that his father's hurt.</s>If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.</s>They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.</s>Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?</s>No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.</s>Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?</s>
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.</s>Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.</s>But that's what happened before.</s>Not this time.</s>
Anybody home?</s>As a matter of fact--</s>Sir?</s>As a matter of fact--I am home.</s>Hello.</s>Hello.</s>Are you--</s>
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?</s>What?</s>Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.</s>That woulda been cool.</s>Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.</s>
Why did you come tonight? To see me?</s>To hear them read Torah.</s>I thought you hated Torah.</s>That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.</s>Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.</s>
Did you look in here?</s>No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.</s>Well, let's broaden our outlook.</s>
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.</s>Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.</s>
How long has my father been like this?</s>Not that often.  He was excited to see you.</s>So he drank himself into a stuper?</s>The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.</s>So what's up with you?</s>I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.</s>
She was right to leave me.</s>You think so?</s>Yes.</s>You really are stupid, you know that.</s>
This gun yours?</s>No.</s>Who's is it?</s>I'll have to try to remember.</s>Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.</s>
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.</s>Sure.</s>Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.</s>Why not?</s>I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.</s>
How about you?</s>I don't want you to get hurt.</s>He can't hurt me if he's dead.</s>
Elaine -- are you serious about this?</s>I'll think about it.</s>You really will?</s>Yes.</s>
Patrick?</s>Can you bring Mr...</s>
Do you recognize him?</s>...Even his mother wouldn't.</s>
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.</s>What?</s>You know.</s>What?</s>Magic.  It was magic.</s>Magic.</s>I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --</s>Mom!</s>Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --</s>Mom, we already...</s>Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?</s>Like... clockwork.</s>
Give me a hand?</s>For sure.</s>

I'm in your debt, Screwball.</s>Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!</s>
But there is a family resemblance.</s>You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?</s>We planted it.</s>Is this your shovel?</s>No.</s>Possession of a stolen shovel.</s>Officer, I can explain.</s>Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...</s>Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.</s>Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?</s>Check.</s>And that truck - is it registered in your name?</s>Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.</s>Then whose name is it registered in?</s>Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?</s>Where are the papers?</s>I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?</s>Wait here.</s>Because if you are...</s>Lady! Be quiet.</s>
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.</s>We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.</s>
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.</s>Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.</s>
Well...</s>No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.</s>I'll go.</s>Pardon me?</s>I'll go.</s>You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?</s>
It's beautiful. Thank you.</s>I hope it brings you luck.</s>It will.</s>
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?</s>Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.</s>
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.</s>Why would I let you do that?</s>I know where the money is.</s>If you knew, you would have it with you.</s>I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.</s>I know something better.</s>What's that.</s>I know where it's going to be.</s>And where is that.</s>It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.</s>
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?</s>Who?</s>The guy in the Halloween suit!</s>
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.</s>Any criminal record?</s>Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.</s>Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.</s>How does the family survive?</s>Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.</s>
Impossible? Why?</s>Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.</s>But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?</s>I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.</s>
You missed on purpose.</s>I didn't. I told you, I can't --</s>What's that?</s>
Are they still here, Otho?</s>Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.</s>
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.</s>You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.</s>
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...</s>What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?</s>You tell them, Lieutenant.</s>

You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.</s>No kidding?</s>
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.</s>A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.</s>But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?</s>
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?</s>I'm dizzy, not deaf.</s>Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?

He used that?</s>Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.</s>So why isn't it all bloody?</s>I assume he licked it clean.</s>
Why's that?</s>Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake.</s>
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...</s>He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!</s>

He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.</s>You don't have to hunt to do it.</s>Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?</s>

I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.</s>What's your offer?</s>Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.</s>Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?</s>Benefits?</s>You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation.

Judaism there's nothing.</s>Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.</s>What's it about?</s>About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....</s>And belief follows?</s>No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul.

He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.</s>Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?</s>
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.</s>For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?</s>That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.</s>It's probably because you got him fired.</s>Ya think?</s>Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!</s>
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?</s>I have to.</s>You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?</s>Because it's his bad luck to be special.</s>He thinks you want him to look at evidence.</s>Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...</s>You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.</s>
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.</s>Well done.</s>
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.</s>What, leaving school...</s>... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...</s>

How quaint.</s>It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.</s>
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?</s>Why not?  They seem friendly enough.</s>Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.</s>How many of those drinks did you have?</s>Three.</s>I thought so.</s>
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?</s>Damned if I know.</s>

What happens if I can't catch him?</s>If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.</s>How do you know I won't run?</s>
Oh my God, I look awful.</s>You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.</s>
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.</s>That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.</s>

The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.</s>Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?</s>The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.</s>All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.</s>We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.</s>A beach named X? That I'd like to see.</s>So there you have it.

It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.</s>He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.</s>How so?</s>Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.

But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.</s>That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?</s>I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.</s>What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?</s>Did ya see what happened to anybody else?</s>Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.</s>At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.</s>What do you think?</s>What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.</s>Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.</s>Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?</s>You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -</s>Nope.</s>How can you be so sure?</s>I got the diamonds.</s>Where?</s>I got 'em, all right?</s>Where? Are they out in the car?</s>No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.</s>That was the plan, we meet here.</s>Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.</s>I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.</s>What?</s>Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.</s>No shit?</s>Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.</s>So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.</s>I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.</s>Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.</s>For all I know, you're the rat.</s>Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.</s>That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.</s>Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?</s>

Aw, don't... no...</s>Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.</s>I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?</s>
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...</s>Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?</s>
He's gonna die, ain't he?</s>Maybe.</s>Well, suppose he does?</s>We'll bury him.</s>That ain't what I mean.</s>You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?</s>I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.</s>An' if I spot 'em?</s>I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!</s>Just like that?</s>I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.</s>Yeah?</s>Hell, yeah.</s>

I thought you were over it.</s>I am. Well, maybe not completely--</s>
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt</s>It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.</s>I would like to explain something of my mission here.</s>That was my first question.</s>It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.</s>Yes -- that is true.</s>In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.</s>If you mean that you are afraid of us--</s>We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.</s>These other planets -- do they have peace and security?</s>We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.</s>We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?</s>I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.</s>Would you care to be more specific?</s>What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.</s>
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."</s>I don't blame him.</s>"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."</s>
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!</s>Is she all right?</s>
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.</s>Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.</s>
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.</s>Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?</s>
No... it can't end like that...</s>But it has. There is no more to tell.</s>But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?</s>It's over, I'm telling you...</s>You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.</s>
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?</s>Here...</s>'Here'?</s>
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.</s>Pretty hefty. Keep reading.</s>'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'</s>
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.</s>Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?</s>
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.</s>What's wrong with it?</s>Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.</s>
Wow, Josie- you look really-</s>Rufus?</s>Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.</s>Thanks. And what are -</s>Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".</s>
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.</s>I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!</s>
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.</s>Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.</s>A speech impediment?</s>

What are you thinking?</s>Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.</s>
Somebody's been here.</s>Where are we now?</s>My place, can't you see?</s>No.</s>You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.</s>Right.</s>Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.</s>I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.</s>Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.</s>
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.</s>Ted?  Are you there?</s>Yeah.</s>Any prospects?</s>Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.</s>How the hell are you going to do that?</s>I don't know.</s>
What are you doing in New York...?</s>Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...</s>
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?</s>Good.  You have kids?</s>
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.</s>You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.</s>Over three hundred miles.</s>You seem pleased by the prospect.</s>Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!</s>
Robert, do you mind?</s>What?</s>Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?</s>
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.</s>Yes.</s>
Just keep quiet.</s>I have to answer him.</s>So you can give us away?</s>If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.</s>

Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.</s>Yeah.</s>But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.</s>How did she smell? Did her puss stink?</s>
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?</s>What octopus motor?</s>You know, to make the legs move --</s>Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!</s>

Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.</s>Oh Jesus...</s>
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?</s>Spontaneously combust?</s>
Any ideas about the colour?</s>Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?</s>Has it been exposed to any sun before now?</s>I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?</s>
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?</s>"Changes."</s>"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?</s>No. What?</s>Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.</s>One of those ... big beds?</s>
Did you order our houses burned down?</s>Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.</s>

Yeah. I though you ran this joint.</s>Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?</s>
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.</s>I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.</s>And what do you believe?</s>

There's no hope in it.</s>It's the truth.</s>Without hope there's no point to anything.</s>Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.</s>Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.</s>

Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.</s>Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?</s>We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.</s>Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.</s>Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders.

Mikey, I hoped...</s>No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.</s>

I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.</s>Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.</s>Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.</s>Whatever that means. Open your presents.</s>
Do you wish to be baptized?</s>I do wish to be baptized.</s>
Jesus.</s>Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.</s>
God rest her soul.</s>I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.</s>
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.</s>Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.</s>
Landon. You go on home.</s>I'm not tired.</s>I need to be with her.</s>
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...</s>You all set here?</s>
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.</s>What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?</s>
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.</s>WHICH?</s>...I'll tell you later.</s>
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!</s>Mph rmprmmh rm!!</s>I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!</s>MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!</s>AGAGAH!!</s>

...in.</s>I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...</s>I don't recall inviting you.</s>
Am I not safe enough with you, John?</s>Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.</s>The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.</s>I'll decide when it's exaggerated.</s>
Tell the truth.</s>I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.</s>
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.</s>I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...</s>School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.</s>How often do you go?</s>I don't go at all.</s>
TV repair.</s>TV repair?</s>Yeah. TV busted?</s>Yeah ...</s>Well here I am.</s>
Zuria?</s>Yes. Until proven otherwise.</s>I would like to ask you something.</s>Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?</s>
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!</s>No, It's nothing!</s>You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.</s>
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?</s>I don't know.</s>
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.</s>You know where it is?</s>What?</s>I know where it is.</s>
Hey!</s>Hey. Do you have a cigarette?</s>No I quit.</s>Hey, you said you did a video?</s>Yup.</s>What's it about?</s>It's really not about anything.</s>Oh. Well, what's it on?</s>A cloud.</s>A cloud?</s>Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.</s>Oh.</s>I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.</s>Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.</s>You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?</s>Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.</s>Your a nurse?</s>No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.</s>Any gunshot victims?</s>Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.</s>Sounds like a bummer.</s>Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.</s>Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?</s>Right now?</s>Yeah.</s>I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?</s>Do you wanna go to the van?</s>Now?</s>Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?</s>I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.</s>Okay, whatever you want.</s>
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!</s>Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.</s>We've got powder but no ball!</s>Then use rocks!</s>
Been waiting long?</s>Just got here.</s>How'd we do?</s>A.D. is a C.P.A.</s>Come again... ?</s>Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.</s>Maybe it's enough.</s>
Looks like a tie.</s>Who's gonna win?</s>We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...</s>
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.</s>Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.</s>
What'd you come back for, babe?</s>Just had to be sure.</s>
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.</s>And, of course, we are.</s>Well, you never can tell these days, can you?</s>
Hello, I'm here about the ad.</s>Please, have a seat.</s>
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.</s>Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?</s>
Suck a dick, I left my purse...</s>As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'</s>Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?</s>Ye-ah.</s>
It's desperate that I talk to her.</s>I've already told you, she's not home.</s>Well please leave a message that I called.</s>I'll do that.</s>
This is a mistake. We better forget it.</s>You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.</s>
We didn't see anything -  - did we?</s>No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -</s>
What's with the look?</s>The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...</s>You look like you lost your sheep ...</s>
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.</s>I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.</s>Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.</s>
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.</s>Yeah, well, you're late.</s>Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.</s>We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.</s>Nobody goes there anymore.</s>
Pritchett, is that you?</s>Up here --</s>
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.</s>Oh shit, what's today?</s>Today is Tuesday.  What?</s>I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?</s>Give 'em a box of Macanudos.</s>Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.</s>
WHAT did you say?</s>I said welcome.</s>WELCOME?</s>Well, of course. We always welcome friends.</s>
Agent Desmond, it's...</s>It's late, Sam.</s>It's not late, it's early. Really early.</s>
We're losing the pattern...!</s>Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!</s>
But what?</s>I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.</s>Daddy --</s>No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.</s>
Forget it. That's past.</s>No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.</s>
Mikey loves his birthday present.</s>Where is he?</s>He's sitting in it.</s>
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.</s>Skipper, you can't do this!</s>I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...</s>
Are you freaking out?</s>Little bit.  Yeah.</s>
I've even printed my own currency.</s>"Emperor Miguelito...?"</s>The first.</s>Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?</s>Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!</s>So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?</s>
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?</s>I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!</s>Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.</s>It's Fenner.</s>
What?!</s>Oh, God.</s>
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.</s>He's not going tonight.</s>I told his father he'd be on that flight.</s>Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.</s>Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.</s>And you're not the wife.</s>It's not a contest.</s>Damn straight.</s>
...I should?</s>YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?</s>
Isn't it like, obvious?</s>Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.</s>
Hi. can I come in?</s>Yeah. hurry up though.</s>
I object, your Honor...</s>Overruled...</s>Exception!</s>Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...</s>
Don't know that it does.</s>Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?</s>Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.</s>
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?</s>Of course, he's concealed about me person.</s>No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.</s>
I wouldn't -</s>Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.</s>
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?</s>How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?</s>You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?</s>Here. Take them.</s>
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.</s>Hector, don't interrupt me.</s>He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.</s>I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?</s>
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.</s>How come you don't stay with them?</s>Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?</s>No.  I don't.</s>
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.</s>That's why I'll be there at 8:45.</s>I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.</s>Forget it.</s>
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.</s>What, you think I did this to myself?</s>
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.</s>Let's go in.</s>Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.</s>You abide by rules like that?</s>Ahm...</s>
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.</s>Fuck you.</s>
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.</s>here, here.</s>
Then where's it coming from?</s>From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.</s>
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.</s>Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.</s>
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.</s>I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!</s>I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.</s>
Who's that?</s>Just a guard.</s>I shot at one of them.</s>But you didn't hurt anybody.</s>
...I don't get it.</s>Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.</s>Yeah.</s>And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...</s>
How do you get out of the house?</s>I walk out.</s>You walk right out the door.</s>
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.</s>My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.</s>No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.</s>
Yes.</s>Well, did you get a job out of it at least?</s>I'd like you to leave now.</s>
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.</s>Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?</s>Closer to eight.</s>So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.</s>
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.</s>That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.</s>Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.</s>It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.</s>What if he doesn't run?</s>That means he probably will kill Johnnie.</s>Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!</s>Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.</s>okay, all right.</s>We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.</s>
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!</s>Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?</s>Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.</s>
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?</s>Now?</s>
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?</s>I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...</s>He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.</s>
What does she say?</s>She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.</s>He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.</s>
I could like kill a guy with these things.</s>It's in your closet.</s>I've worn some kinky stuff before ...</s>He won't notice anyway.</s>What do you mean?</s>They don't notice that kind of thing.</s>So what's the point?</s>Jen please ...</s>He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...</s>Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.</s>
Oh dear God...</s>What is 'fisting'?</s>
What are those for?</s>Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...</s>Umm...</s>
Annette, just use your hand.</s>They told me to practice.</s>
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.</s>My son! Do you really think, Ma....</s>Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.</s>
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.</s>Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.</s>
Wait!  Professor...?</s>... Yes?</s>
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.</s>Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.</s>
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?</s>It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.</s>
I don't know why.</s>I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!</s>
Did you suggest any?</s>Yes -- Insulin and others.</s>What did she say?</s>She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.</s>-- And what did you suggest?</s>Cocaine.</s>
Here it is; the last chapter.</s>Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.</s>I'll pass the word on, then.</s>I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.</s>I'll be waiting.</s>Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.</s>
Where the hell have you been?</s>We got problems topside.</s>Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?</s>We run. You crack the pattern?</s>Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.</s>You can make your move when it comes after me.</s>What are you talkin' about?</s>I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.</s>
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!</s>I told him not to sit down in there.....</s>
Morning!</s>Erin?  What are you --</s>You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.</s>
Asshole that does not count as a kill.</s>Yes it does.</s>Oh, come on!</s>
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?</s>You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?</s>
Tony Marvin.</s>Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?</s>His dry cleaners.  You want him?</s>What do you think?  What's this?</s>
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.</s>What if our guys open up, sir?</s>You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.</s>Have it your way, Captain.</s>
No.</s>My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.</s>
What do we do now?</s>I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.</s>
He just came up screaming.</s>Did he say anything?</s>He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.</s>And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?</s>The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.</s><u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.</s>Yes.</s>Is the dead guy in there?</s>That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?</s>Um.  No, no.  Let's go.</s>
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.</s>Why should they think that?</s>You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.</s>Frankly that's how I remember it.</s>But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.</s>Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.</s>That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.</s>Did he say who?</s>No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.</s>
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?</s>Just considering our options... sir.</s>
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.</s>Please tell me.</s>
You're on fire!</s>Not this again --</s>No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!</s>
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.</s>A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.</s>Let me see the plant press.</s>
Should I?</s>His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.</s>Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.</s>More.</s>More's gonna cost you.</s>
Jack?... Jack?</s>Shut up!</s>Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.</s>Bastard!!!</s>This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.</s>
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.</s>Damn.  Let's go.</s>
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.</s>And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.</s>Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.</s>Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.</s>Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.</s>
Yes -- who spoke up?</s>I did, sir.</s>
'Joe...'</s>Yes.</s>Is there any more to it?</s>What do you mean?</s>Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'</s>
Yes?</s>Were you recently in the bathroom?</s>What on earth gave you that idea?</s>The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...</s>You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?</s>When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?</s>
Charming Schuvaloff.</s>Black-eyed Sczortarska.</s>Dark Valdez.</s>Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?</s>Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.</s>And he doesn't care about me?</s>He is only curious to know who you are.</s>If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.</s>He loves me, as I love you.</s>Will he wish to know the details of this night?</s>He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.</s>Tender Hegenheim.</s>
...That's an old one.</s>Buy us some Thunderbird, man.</s>
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.</s>Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.</s>I want to try.</s>What?</s>I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.</s>Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.</s>Now?</s>Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.</s>
Subtle?</s>I disappear. It’s not about me.</s>
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.</s>Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.</s>
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.</s>Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?</s>He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.</s>But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?</s>
I think you're on the right track.</s>I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.</s>
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?</s>Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.</s>I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.</s>You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!</s>
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!</s>Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?</s>Sooner is better than later!</s>
And she's all wrong for me!</s>Well, somet...</s>I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.</s>
Look at the stars.</s>Yes. They're old friends.</s>Do you think there is any life up there?</s>I don't know. Perhaps.</s>Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.</s>We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.</s>You should have been a poet.</s>Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -</s>
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.</s>Oh, but it will end well for love?</s>In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.</s>Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.</s>
This the place?</s>Yeah.  How much?</s>
Oh yeah?</s>You work around town?</s>I'm a teacher.</s>Went to college, huh?</s>In Birmingham.</s>Oh yeah? That's my home town.</s>Your folks live there?</s>No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?</s>Yes, aren't you?</s>No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?</s>My father's the preacher.</s>Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.</s>That's right.</s>Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?</s>Maybe.</s>
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.</s>Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?</s>Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?</s>Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.</s>
Natalie? Natalie who?</s>Why?</s>
No one would blame me if I left!</s>I'd blame you.  I want you here.</s>I'm not doing it!</s>It'll be fine.</s>Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?</s>I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.</s>
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?</s>I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.</s>You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.</s>
How do we know what room she's in?</s>Wait here.</s>
Wow. You look beautiful.</s>Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn’t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.</s>
Ready?</s>Yeah.</s>
And they got Penny!  Look!</s>Don't shoot!</s>

I think I'll go for a walk.</s>You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?</s>I feel happy... I feel happy.</s>

You're gonna let us go?</s>In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.</s>
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.</s>Did he say that?</s>Jody he was lying.</s>What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?</s>I guess not.</s>He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.</s>
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?</s>I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?</s>Walter--</s>

Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -</s>Starling -</s>But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!</s>The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay?

Is it possible...?</s>All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?</s>
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.</s>I know.</s>
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.</s>It’s over, Cotton.</s>Not until you’re dead.</s>

Good God.</s>My Lord.</s>
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.</s>I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.</s>It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.</s>If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.</s>I do it all the time!</s>Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...</s>I'd be there for him.</s>And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.</s>Okay, okay...</s>

What's your frank estimation of the British?</s>Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?</s>They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.</s>And a French alliance?</s>Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?</s>It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.</s>
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.</s>No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.</s>Oh. So...</s>

Nigel, get lost.</s>I have to talk to you.</s>You're wasting your breath.</s>You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.</s>I could teach you a thing or two now.</s>

Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?</s>It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?</s>
What the hell you want to go there for?</s>You know it?</s>Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?</s>I don't remember.</s>
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.</s>So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?</s>That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.</s>I'm not touching my film...</s>I'm afraid you are.</s>No, I'm not...</s>We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...</s>

Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.</s>Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.</s>Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.</s>
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?</s>Blind faith is what I consider heresy!</s>

It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!</s>Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?</s>And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!</s>I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.</s>
Hello.</s>Saunders--</s>
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...</s>I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.</s>I don't like it, George...</s>Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?</s>It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...</s>We don't know what else to do. We need results.</s>You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.</s>I'm gonna be here if you need anything.</s>
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.</s>My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.</s>
But you know how to drive?</s>Sure.</s>Got a license?  But no car?</s>Don't need it.</s>I just got my license two weeks ago.</s>You're good.</s>I been drivin' since I was twelve.</s>That would explain it.</s>Can you help Mom?</s>I'm trying.</s>Got to.</s>
So, did you sleep good?</s>Yeah... I have to go to town.</s>
The Partridge Family?</s>I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.</s>Good call.</s>So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?</s>I dazzled him with my wit</s>
What?!</s>You better come see this.</s>
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.</s>... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.</s>
What happened?</s>It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.</s>
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.</s>Yeah, where's your machine gun.</s>Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?</s>
I don't know anything about Zavitz.</s>You said he was behind an extortion scheme.</s><u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.</s>
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...</s>... including me.  Right?</s>I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.</s>You mean,  me?</s>It's possible.</s>
Sorry.</s>I mean, I'm having a good time with you...</s>
Child molestation is a touchy subject...</s>Could you--</s>...with the affiliates.</s>Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!</s>Yes, but you name names.</s>We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.</s>
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.</s>And...</s>He saw an owl.</s>
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.</s>What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].</s>You don't believe it was a car accident.</s>What do you think.</s>Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.</s>Depends, don' it.</s>On what.  What makes you so certain.</s>I'll bloody well ask him.</s>There's the phone.  You want his number.</s>
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.</s>I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?</s>That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?</s>They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.</s>Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.</s>
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?</s>Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.</s>
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?</s>Nearly four years...</s>
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.</s>Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?</s>If God intends you to go, then you will go.</s>Damn God!</s>
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.</s>You think this is all a joke?</s>Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?</s>Ian's a very good friend of mine.</s>He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.</s>I believe in him.</s>
Good.</s>He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.</s>
What do you want to talk about?</s>You know what about.</s>
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?</s>I guess we're going to find out.</s>You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--</s>Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?</s>
You make me feel...</s>Loved?</s>That. And less strange.</s>
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.</s>Honors -- hup!</s>
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.</s>Yeah, yeah, I did.</s>Good man.  And is she all right?</s>Yeah.</s>Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?</s>Yeah.</s>Are you all right, Barney?</s>
How do you want us?</s>Up there.</s>
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?</s>It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.</s>Uh-huh.</s>Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.</s>You're sure?</s>Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.</s>That's what everybody believes?</s>Yes, sir. It's true.</s>What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"</s>Yes. That's kind of how it was.</s>Uh-huh.</s>
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?</s>Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?</s>You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.</s>Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?</s>I said not as a rule.</s>So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?</s>Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.</s>What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.</s>What happened to Mandrake the Magician?</s>Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--</s>Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...</s>And the one driving the other car?</s>What're you talking about?</s>Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.</s>Glenn Michaels.</s>Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.</s>He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.</s>
Do you really think Billy did it?</s>He was there, Tatum.</s>I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.</s>
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.</s>I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.</s>I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.</s>We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."</s>
That was 'Joe'.</s>He's cute.</s>Very.</s>
What happened?</s>I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.</s>Okay...</s>Is this the only way?</s>Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...</s>
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.</s>What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?</s>
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?</s>I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.</s>
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -</s>This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.</s>How do you do, Charles?</s>
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!</s>Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.</s>Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!</s>
...You are ze fahzer?</s>No. Uh... family friend.</s>
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.</s>He was Harry's driver?</s>Mmmm.</s>
We gotta get you to a doctor.</s>It's okay.  Forget it.</s>Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.</s>
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...</s>Who's that?</s>
Someone should give you a raise.</s>Actually, sir, you could be that someone.</s>
Spock, that was actually funny.</s>We DO sleep lying down.</s>
Daddy?</s>Yeah?</s>I'm sorry...</s>That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.</s>
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.</s>You are the same?</s>Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?</s>Yes.  Always.</s>Does it change with me in the room?</s>It is less.</s>You feel you know me.</s>I don't know why.</s>We are brothers.</s>
Game six is history,pal.</s>You're not making sense.</s>
Big weddings are so strange.</s>You keep saying that.</s>
What's wrong?</s>Nothing.</s>Nothing?</s>
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.</s>If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.</s>I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.</s>We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.</s>
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?</s>I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.</s>Jesus Christ.</s>Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?</s>Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.</s>No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?</s>
We're not even sure what it was.</s>What else could've done that?</s>
Oh! What is it?</s>"Proud... to be... an... American."</s>
Maybe you should get over fears.</s>Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.</s>
What's all this pudding?</s>It's not mine.</s>Why's it here?</s>I have no idea.</s>
You - you killed him?</s>No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.</s>
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --</s>I know how DNA works, Erin --</s>
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?</s>Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?</s>It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!</s>But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??</s>The monkey, of course. It was his idea.</s>Monkeybone...!?</s>Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.</s>You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??</s>Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!</s>
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.</s>When? How?</s>I dunno ... he's gonna call me...</s>
Hypnotizing.</s>Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'</s>
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.</s>Well, do something!</s>
But I..</s>Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?</s>
Patrizia, what are you going to do?</s>What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.</s>I'll go and get my valise.</s>
Could I have that, please?</s>Why not? It was getting warm anyway.</s>
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?</s>Steve.</s>
Why does everyone have to act that way?</s>You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...</s>"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!</s>Is it? Is this what you want?</s>
Yeah, do you know 'em?</s>No, just checking.</s>
Must you walk so quickly?</s>It's good exercise, Mom.</s>
Finished your estimate?</s>Well, there's several ways to go .</s>Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.</s>
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?</s>What?</s>I asked if you felt like a drink--</s>No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.</s>Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.</s>
Are you wearing a coconut bra?</s>Oh, you're good.</s>Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.</s>Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.</s>You mean the lunch room?</s>
I'm sorry?</s>I know how hard it can be sometimes.</s>
Eat your mustard.</s>It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.</s>
...He's not noticing, Benny.</s>Maybe he's wise.</s>He don't look wise.</s>Plan two: Here come the waterworks.</s>
No!</s>Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.</s>No!</s>Yes.</s>
Your blood.</s>All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.</s>Loretta.</s>I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.</s>I've got you.</s>Get all of me. Take everything.</s>What about Johnny?</s>You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!</s>Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.</s>
I got some vodka in the freezer.</s>Got some o.j.?</s>Yeah.</s>
This is Matt Hooper...</s>I know who he is...</s>He's from the Oceanographic Institute.</s>
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.</s>I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.</s>
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?</s>No!</s>
Sandy... What's up?</s>Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?</s>No.</s>Shit. Here we go again.</s>Didn't you see her this morning?</s>To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.</s>
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.</s>Don't count on it.</s>
...Anaheim...</s>...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.</s>
Seems more like a year than a month.</s>Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...</s>
Pritchett!</s>Over here!</s>
Sounds like the hull.</s>Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.</s>
That must be four thousand yards.</s>Forty-two-hundred, I figure.</s>You take account of the wind?</s>
You what?!  How did you do that?</s>I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.</s>
Yeah, Sykes?</s>Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.</s>
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?</s>Well, it's Billy.</s>And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?</s>Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.</s>Well, it was a silly question.</s>He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.</s>Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?</s>Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?</s>
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.</s>I see...</s>Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.</s>If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?</s>Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.</s>
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.</s>Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.</s>
What's wrong with that?</s>I'm not sure about this.</s>I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.</s>
Damn.  They're early.</s>Who?</s>I called you a taxi.</s>Very thoughtful.</s>Well, you know...</s>
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.</s>Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.</s>
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.</s>And they think they are protecting my by moving.</s>You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?</s>Mess that kid up?</s>
How... was she "called?"</s>Pardon?</s>Aunt Edith. How did she... die?</s>
Claire...</s>DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.</s>

Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.</s>I'll see you tomorrow.</s>
A homosexual encounter.</s>Get real.</s>Unprotected sex with a prostitute.</s>Uh.... No. Not really.</s>Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.</s>
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.</s>I also gotta win.</s>
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?</s>Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.</s>By all means.</s>
Dammit, Carl!!!!</s>Sorry.</s>
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...</s>I guess I'd better get it right the first time.</s>The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.</s>
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.</s>No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?</s>Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!</s>
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.</s>It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.</s>
You know what?  You can go.</s>Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?</s>
There is a way.</s>I knew it!</s>But it's impossible.</s>Why?</s>No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.</s>
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.</s>Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...</s>What are you talking about?</s>Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.</s>
Balefire on you, Selena!</s>You Scorpios can never take a joke.</s>
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?</s>No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.</s>I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.</s>Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.</s>
What's your daddy's name?</s>Nathan Lee Morgan...</s>
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.</s>It's already out.</s>The Police, then...</s>Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...</s>Then where do we go?!</s>I don't know.</s>
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!</s>Goodnight.</s>
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?</s>I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.</s>
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.</s>What of it?</s>It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...</s>What of it?</s>
Did you get a report from the M.E.?</s>Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?</s>If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?</s>You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.</s>
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --</s>Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...</s>
It's obviously him!</s>I can't believe it!</s>
Are you frightened?</s>Why should I be?</s>
What do you mean?</s>Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.</s>
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.</s>Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.</s>You want unpleasant?

Wait.</s>What?</s>Your coat jacket is rising up in back.</s>
What is it doing?</s>It's scared of me.</s>
No, don't Jack, don't.</s>Who sent you, Thorpey?</s>Brumby!</s>
That's the whole works, right up to date.</s>Sentimental fellow, aren't you?</s>Yes and no.</s>Well, thanks a lot.</s>See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.</s>
This part isn't about the virus, is it?</s>Hey, man...</s>It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.</s>They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?</s>Who am I supposed to shoot?</s>

You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?</s>I gave him twenty.</s>

Well, I'm not.</s>Then you'll call, right?</s>
I want you to take Miss Lund home.</s>Yes, sir.</s>
You got nothin' on me.</s>We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.</s>
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.</s>Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.</s>Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.</s>You have the key, Mr. McAllister.</s>
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.</s>There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—</s>Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.</s>
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...</s>But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.</s>Let him patch up his own breeches...</s>
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.</s>I'm sorry but ...</s>You remember Samuel, my son.</s>{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...</s>We're meeting Mrs Terrain.</s>

God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!</s>It's me.</s>You're fucking dead!</s>I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.</s>
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.</s>What?  <u>Why</u>?</s>I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.</s>
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...</s>Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?</s>
You want some berries?</s>Hunh?</s>
You switched license plates?</s>It's taken care of.</s>We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.</s>Not this minute.</s>
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?</s>He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.</s>Hey, let's go spy on them.</s>
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.</s>It's not myself I'm worried about.</s>I'll do fine.</s>
We're moving through time.</s>What?</s>
No.</s>I don't mind.</s>You should go home.</s>Can't I stay a little longer?</s>It's getting dark. Go home.</s>Will I see you again?</s>
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?</s>No.</s>
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...</s>No children?</s>If that's true, they're a dying race.</s>
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?</s>Mother?</s>
...one shot...</s>So that's what a lion looks like.</s>
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.</s>It is a pity.</s>
Jack...</s>Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.</s>
What could possible be funny?</s>I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.</s>
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.</s>Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.</s>I'm afraid I don't understand.</s>Oh, my God, he's a natural.</s>
Don't do it.</s>I have to, Valerie.</s>
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?</s>We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!</s>No!</s>Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.</s>
Good-night dad.</s>Good night kiddo.</s>
I do what I gotta do to survive.</s>You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.</s>I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.</s>I'm your blood.</s>You wish!</s>
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...</s>We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.</s>

Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?</s>Okay. First I rip your clothes off...</s>
You look in his citation book?</s>Yah...</s>
Well, if it's a discharge --</s>It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.</s>
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.</s>We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.</s>The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.</s>
You didn't like him.</s>Anyone got a cigarette.</s>
Do you really need these?</s>Only to see.</s>Can't you get contacts?</s>No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.</s>Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.</s>
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?</s>Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.</s>
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.</s>Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.</s>
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.</s>She told me I have to.</s>No, Jim.</s>I do.  If I don't get my money back...</s>
Praxis?</s>What's left of it.</s>
Jimmy?</s>What the fuck are you doing here?</s>Do you remember me?</s>Yeah, I remember you.</s>You Jimmy Grantz?							  *</s>Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?</s>
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.</s>Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.</s>Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.</s>
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.</s>Bill, he's a crazy man.</s>
Calm down. Take a deep breath.</s>You're right. You're right.</s>
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.</s>Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.</s>Oh... I guess I'll die now.</s>Okay... maybe that would be best.</s>
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.</s>I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.</s>You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.</s>
Want something to drink? I'm buying.</s>No, thanks.</s>Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.</s>Why?</s>I wanted to use your car.</s>
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...</s>They what? What? No. No. Why?</s>The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...</s>
Hypotheticals --</s>I'm just wondering --</s>
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?</s>You're the Tribune man?</s>Yeah, hello. How are you?</s>
You going to eat this?</s>What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?</s>Answer him dick!</s>Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?</s>
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...</s>... we're the bait.</s>
That's where we're all going.</s>In my time, and nobody else's.</s>
He was trying to kill you, right!</s>Yes.</s>Not the other way around...?</s>No.</s>Is it something you've done?</s>It's something I do...</s>
They couldn't do anything for me.</s>How 'bout the morgue?</s>No.  I have one more thing to do.</s>
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.</s>You aren't angry with me?</s>Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.</s>
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!</s>Yes!</s>
Ouch..</s>What's wrong?</s>That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.</s>Do you still love her?</s>Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.</s>Well, have you asked her to come back?</s>
Yeah, look at me.</s>Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...</s>
I know what's bugging you, of course.</s>Oh? I didn't know anything was.</s>Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.</s>Not very good!</s>
Well, let's hope not!</s>Yeah, that'd be a big shame...</s>
There's something else I would like you to help me with.</s>Name it.</s>Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.</s>Oh, I'm sure it will!</s>Then forget it.</s>No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?</s>This is for me.</s>Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.</s>
Epps.</s>Yeah.</s>I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.</s>Thanks.</s>This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...</s>Threatened to blow my brains out?</s>Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.</s>Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.</s>
He's in here.</s>Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?</s>Ok.</s>
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.</s>Why not just buy your baby a night light?</s>That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.</s>With, like, images?</s>Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.</s>
I think I'm going fucking crazy.</s>I can't believe...</s>
Stay up there, Girl...</s>Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...</s>
What is he?</s>I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.</s>Oh, a little savage, is he?</s>A proper Aborigine.</s>

Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?</s>Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.</s>Obviously.  Very difficult.</s>
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.</s>I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.</s>
Ah?</s>You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...</s>Who?</s>Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...</s>When was this?</s>This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.</s>What they say?</s>You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.</s>
Do you wanna have sex?</s>Yeah.</s>
Someone was expecting that.</s>You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.</s>

Where is Pancakes Hause?</s>What?</s>We stop at Pancakes Hause.</s>What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.</s>
Go away.</s>What kind of a silly thing was that to do?</s>To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.</s>It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.</s>Great stars have great pride.</s>
What's next?</s>I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.</s>Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?</s>Nope.</s>
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.</s>Thanks.</s>Call me later, hon.</s>
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.</s>At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...</s>
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.</s>Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.</s>
Not that Mulwray?</s>Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.</s>Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...</s>
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.</s>Except us.</s>It IS possible.</s>
How do you feel?</s>Pretty strange.</s>
Bill --</s>Yes?</s>You've got a deal.</s>
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.</s>We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.</s>Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.</s>
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?</s>About four hours.</s>
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.</s>Why did you quit?</s>I got scared.</s>I can imagine.</s>Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.</s>You called the casino a cesspit.</s>Well it is. But I know where I am.</s>
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.</s>Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.</s>
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.</s>It's only a machine.</s>
I'll come.</s>Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.</s>
Holy shit, he's a Toon!</s>Surprised?</s>Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.</s>
Do you mean it ?</s>I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !</s>
Can this be stopped?</s>Maybe before the event, never after.</s>
See you later.</s>I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.</s>I'll pass.</s>
I think I've made my point with you tonight.</s>Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?</s>What's that?</s>Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?</s>Well, you'll find out next year.</s>No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.</s>If you graduate.</s>You're gonna flunk me?!</s>
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.</s>I didn't.</s>You're lying.</s>Lying to you -- Why should I?</s>You know that you're in my house.</s>I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.</s>You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.</s>That's my problem, Belle.</s>
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?</s>I'm always serious.</s>Wow!</s>
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...</s>...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!</s>Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!</s>
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.</s>Oh, Mr. Martins...</s>
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.</s>It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.</s>I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.</s>I could hide you, Tommy.</s>I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.</s>Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?</s>You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.</s>He was a good man.</s>I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--</s>Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.</s>They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...</s>You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!</s>No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.</s>How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?</s>Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...</s>Then what, Tom?</s>Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.</s>I don't understan' it, Tom.</s>Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by.</s>Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?</s>Sure. Good-by.</s>Good-by, Tommy.</s>
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...</s>But it's comfortable.</s>Why don't you try sitting up?</s>Or you could try lying down.</s>You're in quite a mood today.</s>
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?</s>Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.</s>Good! How is the patient?</s>He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.</s>A few words? I thought he was imbecile?</s>Well sir, perhaps I should explain...</s>I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.</s>I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.</s>No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.</s>Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.</s>Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.</s>
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.</s>Did you have a nice time?</s>Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.</s>
I'm telling you, I was there.</s>You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.</s>It wasn't a trick!</s>Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.</s>Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -</s>It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.</s>There weren't any wires. I looked.</s>Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.</s>He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?</s>Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.</s>Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.</s>I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.</s>You're just jealous.</s>Jealous? Of what?</s>Of this...Superman.</s>
That's a heavy sedation.</s>You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.</s>
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?</s>At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.</s>I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?</s>
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?</s>That's enough.</s>You can suck a fuck.</s>
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...</s>Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.</s>
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.</s>Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.</s>We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--</s>Lissen, I heard that before--</s>
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.</s>Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?</s>That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?</s>
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?</s>Hey, Harry.</s>Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!</s>
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?</s>No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.</s>Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.</s>You bet I do, sir.</s>But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.</s>Well, not too, I mean, a little.</s>
What did you do tonight?</s>I watched TV.</s>What did you watch?</s>I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.</s>
No wire.</s>Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.</s>
Don't spend it all in one place.</s>I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.</s>
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.</s>Probably.</s>I don't trust her.</s>Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...</s>
Well... I'm going to go now.</s>Go?</s>Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.</s>Goodbye.</s>
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.</s>I want to talk to General Ripper.</s>But we can't communicate with the base.</s>
Goodbye, Muffin.</s>No, you're the muffin.</s>
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".</s>No shit? Dick, that's great!</s>
Oh my God.</s>What?</s>If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.</s>Who?</s>Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.</s>
Is he...</s>He's alive.</s>
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.</s>I see.</s>I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...</s>
I like Glaucus.</s>Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?</s>Well, I really don't smoke.</s>It's all right.  It's organic.</s>I'm sure picking up on vices.</s>Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."</s>Did Confucius say that?</s>Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.</s>You are the wisest person I know.</s>Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.</s>Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.</s>What was that?</s>Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.</s>How ingenious! Tell me about them.</s>Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?</s>Of course.</s>Okay.</s>
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?</s>Huh?</s>Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.</s>Yeah?</s>
Please...</s>Which way do you want to go?</s>
Thank you, Baron.</s>Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.</s>What time is it?</s>
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.</s>Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.</s>
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.</s>"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?</s>Of course, but there's more --</s>Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...</s>
You're home late... or should I say early?</s>Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.</s>They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.</s>I'll never live as a thief!</s>You're already a thief.</s>That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?</s>Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.</s>Shut up!</s>It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?</s>I owe you nothing.</s>Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.</s>
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.</s>Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.</s>Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.</s>She's in Paris.</s>Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?</s>Not yet.</s>Let me know when you do, all right?</s>
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.</s>I think they mean business.</s>Hang on, boys.</s>
Is this... food!</s>They're called squirbs.</s>
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?</s>He lied to me again.</s>
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.</s>Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?</s>
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?</s>Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--</s>
Are you sure you won't have a drink?</s>No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.</s>
That was good.</s>He heard everything we were saying.</s>
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation.

So. what's next?</s>Pretty clever. Are you game for more?</s>I owe you. since I goofed up this one.</s>You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?</s>Yes. I do.</s>Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.</s>
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?</s>His Highness has not yet taken a wife.</s>No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...</s>
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.</s>I know!</s>
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.</s>Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.</s>
No.</s>He has a little dog.</s>Oh, yes, yes.</s>
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.</s>What about?</s>It's about the burglary.</s>Burglary?</s>Downstairs.</s>Of course.</s>Can we come in?</s>
What's happening?</s>Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.</s>I don't believe it.</s>That what he says. Right?</s>
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.</s>Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.</s>I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers.</s>
I don't kiss.</s>Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.</s>
He lies.  He is here to trap us.</s>I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.</s>
Hazard pay...</s>The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...</s>We weren't real thrilled about it either...</s>
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...</s>Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.</s>I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.</s>Do it. Dr. Weir...</s>
Close your eyes.</s>Why?</s>I've got something for you.</s>A surprise?</s>You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?</s>
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.</s>Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.</s>This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.</s>
Hello, Ford...</s>What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.</s>
Hey now, what is this?</s>Ask him.</s>
Sure.</s>You would?  Really?</s>
This is Weir.</s>Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.</s>
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.</s>All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.</s>
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?</s>I think it is.</s>I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.</s>
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.</s>Now you're lying.</s>You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.</s>
Yeah?</s>José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.</s>Where's the new drop point...?</s>They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...</s>What do you think?</s>It's a rip and a hit.</s>Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...</s>You can't.</s>
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.</s>Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.</s>
Five to three. You’re early.</s>Should I come back in five minutes?</s>
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!</s>It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.</s>
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?</s>You should be dead.  How do you feel?</s>Strange.</s>You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.</s>I wasn't about to.</s>I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.</s>I might say the same.</s>
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.</s>Oh. How about before that?</s>Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.</s>
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.</s>Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.</s>We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.</s>Certainly not at my happy home.</s>
Dammit!</s>Sorry, sir.</s>Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?</s>Patricia Crenshaw.</s>
I beg your pardon?</s>W.P. Mayhew? The writer?</s>Just Bill, please.</s>
How long have you been running this place?</s>How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.</s>
What about the record?</s>Keep it.</s>Can I call you?</s>
Don't you hurt her!</s>Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!</s>
You live in Miami?</s>That's right.</s>What're you doing in Los Angeles?</s>I'm in the movie business.</s>You're an investor, is that it?</s>I'm a producer.</s>You have a card in here?</s>Not yet. I just started.</s>
Jimmy?</s>Who the hell is Jimmy?</s>He's the only one I told.</s>And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.</s>
Miss Hayworth?</s>Yes?</s>I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...</s>
Michael... Michael Myers.</s>YES!</s>
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.</s>You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --</s>Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?</s>
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?</s>And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?</s>I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.</s>
Do you have me?</s>I think so.</s>Show me.</s>
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."</s>I fear nothing.</s>
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.</s>Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.</s>
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!</s>Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!</s>
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.</s>Jos, that's not what we're --</s>Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?</s>
Operator.</s>I need an exit!  Fast!</s>Cypher?</s>
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!</s>Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.</s>Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?</s>I don't think so. It's nice.</s>Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!</s>
It doesn't go like that.</s>Who asked you?</s>If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.</s>
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.</s>I'm listening.</s>
Be reasonable, please....</s>Forget it, he won't listen.</s>
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.</s>Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.</s>
Hello.</s>Beautiful place...</s>Sure is.</s>
Are you all right?  Are you still you?</s>I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?</s>
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?</s>Fragile?</s>
Isn't this a fabulous picture?</s>Yes.</s>She's such a great photographer.</s>Hm.</s>So where should I put it?</s>I thought it was okay where it was.</s>It's much more personal in here.</s>A notch above the storage room.</s>We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?</s>The both of you.</s>But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.</s>So how much do you hate her?</s>Big time.</s>
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.</s>Like what?</s>Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,</s>
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.</s>Thank you.</s>Well, it's the least I can do.</s>Yes, it is.</s>
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."</s>There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.</s>You're not listening to me.</s>No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.</s>What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?</s>I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.</s>All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."</s>Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!</s>Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.</s>
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.</s>What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?</s>I was countin' on it.</s>
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?</s>Move it, Palmer.</s>
Louise!</s>What?!</s>What in the hell is that up there?</s>Where?!</s>Way up ahead!</s>
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?</s>I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.</s>
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.</s>She’s not a girl anymore.</s>
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.</s>I'm sorry.</s>I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.</s>There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.</s>We saw.</s>I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.</s>Where is he now?</s>Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.</s>Who's in command?</s>I am, I think.</s>What are my orders?</s>
What brings the rats out of the sewers?</s>I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...</s>You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?</s>
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'</s>Why didn't he shoot you?</s>I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.</s>
Thanks.</s>If I find anything I'll call you.</s>
Yes.  I am.</s>In that case... no...</s>
He's recovering on the third floor.</s>Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!</s>Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?</s>
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.</s>Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.</s>
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.</s>You look great.</s>
No, Mother, he's lying...</s>Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts</s>
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.</s>The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.</s>I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.</s>
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.</s>That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.</s>You look pretty good for a corpse.</s>Come on, Richard, I'm serious.</s>You're giving me the creeps.</s>Am I dead or not?</s>There's one way to find out.</s>
You can't be serious?</s>I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.</s>Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.</s>That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.</s>Roger, no.</s>What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---</s>Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.</s>So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?</s>
I told you to remain on the command ship.</s>A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.</s>
What's his name?</s>Brill.</s>
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.</s>That's really romantic.</s>
Very good indeed.</s>We have hunted since childhood.</s>All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.</s>That is correct.  Nothing.</s>
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?</s>He'll live.</s>
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.</s>I had so many things to think about!</s>A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.</s>
My father always wanted a boy.</s>Really?  I fail to see the connection.</s>I had a feeling you would. Touche!</s>
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.</s>With pleasure.</s>
Can I ask you something?</s>A dog bit it.</s>Excuse me?</s>You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.</s>And you feel bad for it?</s>It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?</s>
You take her.</s>No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.</s>
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.</s>I ... uh ...</s>
Money?</s>Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.</s>What does that mean?</s>
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.</s>...Do you really want me to forget about you?</s>I don't want to drag you down with me.</s>Daphne, I...</s>
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?</s>I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.</s>
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?</s>Yeah. That was me.</s>Why?</s>Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.</s>Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.</s>You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.</s>You know it's okay.</s>Also, I think I'm in love with you.</s>What, you mean as friends?</s>No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.</s>I try really hard, actually...</s>No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.</s>I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.</s>Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.</s>It does?</s>
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.</s>We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.</s>
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --</s>Thta's not Charlie's work --</s>
Shut down accelerators.</s>Accelerators down.</s>
Why do I always have to sit in back?</s>It's just the way things are, kiddo.</s>Well, I would like to sit in front today.</s>It's not gonna happen.</s>
Hang himself?!</s>He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.</s>We must stop him!</s>Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.</s>But -- but --</s>
Well, get in there.</s>This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.</s>
There goes Mother.</s>Yeah.</s>Let's go peep from the living room.</s>Okay.</s>
I think your life's about to change.</s>So you found Mary?</s>Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.</s>So she hasn't changed?</s>That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?</s>No, not at all.</s>Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.</s>
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.</s>I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.</s>Right.</s>
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?</s>Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.</s>See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid.</s>
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!</s>Come on in!</s>
You got two seconds!</s>Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?</s>
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.</s>I found it! I found it!</s>If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.</s>We won! We won!</s>
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.</s>No... they won't kill me.</s>You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...</s>
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.</s>Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.</s>
Someone dead from this household?</s>We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?</s>What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.</s>My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.</s>Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!</s>They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.</s>
Please don't make this personal --</s>Oh, I think you already have.</s>Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.</s>
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...</s>Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?</s>They lost their son. Why?</s>It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.</s>Are they still operative?</s>Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.</s>Mossad?</s>It’s a good guess...</s>
Scully...</s>Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...</s>
Ahh, sunshine.</s>You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.</s>Change? What's wrong with what I got on?</s>It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.</s>But, mom!</s>Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.</s>
They're having a laugh...</s>WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!</s>That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!</s>
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.</s>Curly.</s>
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?</s>Absolutely. The map is very clear.</s>Let me take a look at that map.</s>
Hal?</s>Yes.</s>
What about me?</s>A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...</s>Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!</s>
Mrs. Peterson.</s>Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...</s>It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?</s>You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...</s>
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.</s>I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.</s>Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?</s>Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?</s>Unless you wanna tell me.</s>He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.</s>One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.</s>I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.</s>Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?</s>I just thought maybe you and me could--</s>
Hey... very tense.</s>Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?</s>Five hundred; six maybe.</s>You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?</s>I think.</s>Give me your checkbook then.</s>It's right under that pile.</s>
Brill?</s>Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.</s>
All right, you two, move along.</s>Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!</s>There's no call for that kind of language.</s>Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!</s>Now see here young man.</s>Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!</s>
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?</s>It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.</s>Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.</s>
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.</s>Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.</s>
He was American?</s>Swiss.</s>Oh. Swiss. His profession?</s>He didn't have one.</s>He was a wealthy man?</s>I don't know. I suppose so.</s>About how wealthy would you say?</s>I don't know.</s>Where did he keep his money?</s>I don't know.</s>Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?</s>I don't know.</s>C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!</s>I know.  I'm sorry.</s>It is all right.</s>
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.</s>C'mon.  It's not that bad</s>Try lookin' at it from this angle</s>
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.</s>Yeah, I know.</s>I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !</s>... he's an amazing officer.</s>You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don''t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick.</s>
"MyDick?"</s>MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.</s>I don't...</s>Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.</s>Speck is dead.</s>I talked to him.</s>
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.</s>You love her, but you hate her?</s>No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?</s>
Yeah. Sure.</s>How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.</s>I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...</s>You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.</s>It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...</s>Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?</s>No. Okay. I'll think about it.</s>
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.</s>Oh... um, William.</s>It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.</s>
What?</s>Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?</s>What are you talking about?</s>The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.</s>I don't believe you.</s>Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.</s>No, no, no, no, no, no . . .</s>After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.</s>Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?</s>It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.</s>So what?</s>
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.</s>That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?</s>That's it.</s>But that wasn't Johnny's fault.</s>I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?</s>
I won't tell.</s>We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.</s>
Too deep to anchor out there.</s>Looks like it's adrift.</s>

How did it go?</s>Fine.</s>
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?</s>Kay... Kay...</s>What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.</s>You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.</s>That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.</s>Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?</s>He's not the same as when I met him.</s>If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.</s>What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.</s>
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.</s>So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?</s>
Chasing around.</s>Chasing what?</s>Money.</s>
This is baloney!</s>He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."</s>
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?</s>I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.</s>
Has Ada ever spoken to you?</s>You mean in signs?</s>No, words. You have never heard words?</s>No, not words.</s>
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.</s>I'd like a little more conviction..</s>So would I.  But it's not mine to give.</s>You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?</s>Something like that.</s>
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.</s>No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.</s>
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?</s>On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.</s>
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.</s>Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.</s>Really?</s>
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!</s>I'm not following you --</s>They're next on the list.  We have to find them.</s>
Fuck him.</s>Don't.</s>Fuck her too.</s>
Maroon uniforms?</s>Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?</s>No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.</s>
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?</s>I don't want to know.</s>Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.</s>Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?</s>She was good in bed, though.</s>Go to sleep.</s>She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.</s>I thought you said it was a nightmare?</s>
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?</s>What?</s>On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.</s>
I can read. I can read!</s>Sorry.</s>
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.</s>Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.</s>
Not much of a pass.</s>Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.</s>Picks up again just on the other side.</s>
What a screw-up.</s>Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.</s>
What's he going to pull--</s>Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--</s>You see any cops?</s>
That was cold...</s>No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.</s>
Be careful, okay?</s>That's my line.</s>
I want to drive awhile.</s>I ain't tired yet.</s>Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.</s>Whaddya mean, buy?</s>Pros.</s>
Are they on the radio?</s>Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.</s>How do you know?</s>I manage them.</s>
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!</s>You won't die if you let me help.</s>Bullshit!</s>But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --</s><u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!</s>You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.</s>
Now what?</s>What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.</s>She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.</s>How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?</s>Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.</s>Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?</s>How did they die?  Was there an investigation?</s>How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?</s>
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --</s>So there are no guests staying on that floor?</s>
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?</s>Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.</s>That could be anybody's.</s>They also found my two beam scale in the garage.</s>Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.</s>The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.</s>So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?</s>I was just going to use it to see how much I had.</s>
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.</s>We'll miss you so.</s>Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.</s>Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.</s>I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.</s>
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.</s>Yes?</s>

Hey, watch it!</s>Sorry there, old Spudhead.</s>
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.</s>I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...</s>Oh, here we go...</s>
Or we could write "expletive deleted."</s>... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!</s>
I've seen him.</s>Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.</s>What are you talkin' about?</s>I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.</s>I don't believe you.</s>That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?</s>On their honeymoon.</s>I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?</s>They didn't tell me.</s>
Why?  What do you mean?</s>Uh...using Josh like that.</s>
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?</s>Want to give my flower a drink.</s>All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.</s>

Police.  Nobody move.</s>He tried to kill me!</s>Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...</s>
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.</s>Well, these things take time.</s>I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...</s>
The security's actually not that severe.</s>It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.</s>
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?</s>Blow me.</s>
What?  What?</s>Like silk?</s>God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.</s>
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.</s>Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?</s>Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.</s>
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.</s>So long, Sefton.</s>
I thought you said he was Peruvian?</s>Haven't you been listening?</s>
Excuse me?</s>You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!</s>
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.</s>Where'd she get you?</s>She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?</s>
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-</s>We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!</s>
And?</s>I'm going to take it.</s>
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?</s>Seventy-two miles an hour.</s>Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?</s>Positive.</s>
Dad!</s>Do I know you?</s>Where've you been?</s>Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.</s>Are you and mom getting a divorce?</s>No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.</s>Who won the fight?</s>Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?</s>Yeah.</s>Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.</s>
No. It's just trying to frighten us.</s>It's succeeding!</s>All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.</s>
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.</s>Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....</s>
Why him?</s>Shut up. You need help, don't you?</s>
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?</s>I've seen him.</s>You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?</s>Only what I read in the papers.</s>Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.</s>I once did a paper on it</s>Really?</s>From the psychiatric end.</s>I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?</s>Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.</s>And Dennings, you read how he died?</s>Yeah, a fall.</s>Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.</s>Couldn't it of happened on the fall.</s>It's possible. Possible however…</s>Unlikely.</s>Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.</s>You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?</s>Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.</s>Sick priest, is that it?</s>Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.</s>I don't know anyone who fits the description.</s>Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?</s>No I probably wouldn't.</s>Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.</s>Is that a threat?</s>No, I mentioned it only in passing.</s>Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.</s>
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--</s>That the problem, son?  You Slow?</s>Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--</s>
A whole lot of nothing.</s>So where do we start?</s>
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.</s>I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.</s>
Did you get that, Hildy?</s>No -- what?</s>
My generosity is not so large as that.</s>What do you want with me?</s>Your love.</s>Your words sting more sharply than your whip.</s>I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.</s>You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!</s>I like well what I see.  It pleases me.</s>But I'm hideous!</s>You're magnificent.</s>Grotesque... monstrous...</s>On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.</s>You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!</s>You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!</s>
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?</s>Yeah. On my way home now.</s>Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.</s>Why, you're the preacher!</s>*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.</s>Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.</s>I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.</s>Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.</s>At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.</s>I never let one go by me when I could catch her.</s>But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.</s>Have a little snort?</s>Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.</s>Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.</s>Been out travelin' around?</s>Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.</s>No, I never. What?</s>I been in the penitentiary for four years.</s>Excuse me for asking.</s>I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.</s>And you ain't ashamed?</s>He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.</s>Ain't you seen your folks since then?</s>No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?</s>It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.</s>
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?</s>I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.</s>Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?</s>He'll be there at 8:30.</s>Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?</s>Yes, sir -- it certainly does!</s>That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.</s>
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?</s>Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.</s>I'll help you out.</s>
Where are you going?</s>I'm going out!</s>You're not going anywhere!</s>Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.</s>Frances!</s>
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?</s>Send for Goebbels.</s>
I was first to respond.</s>What were you doing out here?</s>Drive by patrol.</s>How is she?</s>She's tough.</s>Have to be. The shit she's gone through.</s>
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.</s>That's the point, isn't it?</s>Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?</s>Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?</s>
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.</s>You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -</s>It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.</s>I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -</s>Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?</s>
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.</s>I didn't want to stop.</s>
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.</s>Anybody got any ideas?</s>
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.</s>You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?</s>Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.</s>Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?</s>

You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?</s>It's a crime.</s>Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.</s>I wouldn't do it.</s>You would not...?</s>No.</s>In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?</s>Yes.</s>Just now...</s>Yes.</s>...sworn before God you would tell the truth?</s>Yes.</s>Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?</s>I . . ..</s>And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?</s>I...yes.</s>Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?</s>I...</s>You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.</s>
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.</s>Who's Horace?</s>My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.</s>

The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!</s>What direction does the system indicate?</s>
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.</s>Yes.</s>What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.</s>

Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise.</s>I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...</s>
You guys have any skills at all?</s>Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...</s>
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?</s>It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!</s>
It's beautiful.</s>Even as a boy I thought so.</s>
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.</s>You couldn't.</s>I do.</s>It's just like my grandmother's china.</s>
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?</s>Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...</s>
Yes...  Itís him.</s>This wasnít what we discussed.</s>
What's wrong?</s>Nothing. It's nothing.</s>
Wanna drink.</s>Please.</s>What do you drink?</s>
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?</s>Let's make more popcorn.</s>You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.</s>
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.</s>Still got a sense of humour?</s>Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?</s>Can't say I do.</s>
I knew it.</s>Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.</s>
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.</s>Come on.</s>...where?</s>Come on.</s>
Am I missing something here?</s>I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.</s>He was?</s>It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.</s>You dog! I didn't see you go back there.</s>
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.</s>No.  Stick around.</s>
Hey, Father? You like movies?</s>Very much.</s>I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.</s>That's to bad.</s>Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.</s>Who's in it?</s>Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?</s>I've seen it.</s>One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?</s>Come on!</s>Answer the question, Father Paranoia.</s>Alright. You know who I think really did it?</s>Who?</s>The Dominicans. Go pick on them.</s>I could have you deported, you know that?</s>
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.</s>Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.</s>
Some sort of lead or something.</s>Radiation shield, you think?</s>A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.</s>
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.</s>Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.</s>
You getting this?</s>-- Every word.</s>But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.</s>
Three down, four to go --</s>Then don't waste time talking to me.</s>
What the hell is this?</s>Just some buddies.</s>This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.</s>What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?</s>
Is everything okay?</s>Great. Fine. Perfect.</s>
Emmett.</s>McKendrick.</s>
Do you want to get a drink first?</s>I think they'll probably have booze there.</s>Right.</s>
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?</s>How 'bout me what?</s>How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?</s>What are we gonna see?</s>A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".</s>Who's Sonny Chiba?</s>He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.</s>You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?</s>Three kung fu movies.</s>
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...</s>Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...</s>
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.</s>Hmm.</s>Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...</s>Yeah.</s>...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--</s>
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.</s>H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.</s>
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?</s>Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...</s>It always is.</s>
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?</s>I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.</s>
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.</s>What's your being married got to do with it?</s>It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?</s>
Your Majesty!</s>Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?</s>Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?</s>
Don't you love my sexy body?!</s>I do, baby, I do.</s>
Can I give you a kiss good night?</s>You better not, Jeffrey.</s>Okay, okay.</s>Goodnight.</s>See ya tomorrow.</s>
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.</s>I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.</s>I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.</s>
Choices???</s>Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,</s>
Did you bring a check?</s>What?</s>Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?</s>I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.</s>And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.</s>You got it.</s>And incidental damages, if any...</s>You got it.</s>And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.</s>You got it.</s>And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.</s>Two cases. And dinner when you land.</s>Try some of this. I made it myself.</s>
Will it hurt?</s>That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?</s>
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.</s>I don't get it.</s>You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.</s>
Maybe god's punishing us all...</s>Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.</s>Like Rod Lane?</s>
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.</s>Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.</s>Rob. Please focus.</s>
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?</s>Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.</s>
I think it likes you.</s>It's trying to communicate.</s>
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.</s>Leave me alone!</s>
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.</s>Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...</s>
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --</s>Relax, Baxter.</s>Thank you, sir.</s>
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.</s>Jackie - what are you talking about?</s>Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.</s>It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...</s>
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.</s>No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.</s>You promised to stay on the wagon.</s>The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!</s>Okay, stop being so dramatic.</s>He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!</s>Okay, okay.</s>Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.</s>Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!</s>
Which do you have your money on, Dee?</s>I'd go with number three.</s>Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?</s>
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.</s>No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.</s>
You look a little green.</s>Mm-hmmm...</s>Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.</s>Mm-hmm...</s>
Fucking crow.</s>Sign of the dead come back to life.</s>
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?</s>What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.</s>Sort of.</s>What about?</s>The house payments.</s>
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?</s>Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...</s>And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?</s>I don't know - into the air I suppose.</s>Make a left at this corner.</s>
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.</s>It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.</s>Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.</s>
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?</s>That's correct, sir!</s>Not that one.  Or that one.</s>No, sir!</s>
No.  We can't.</s>Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.</s>We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?</s>Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!</s>We don't know that.</s>Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!</s>Well someone's gonna find them.</s>Hell, it won't be us!</s>
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !</s>Johnny, please. Calm yourself.</s>Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !</s>
Yes?</s>Are you Jody?</s>
It's kind of late.</s>It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.</s>
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -</s>But, Mr. M. -</s>
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.</s>Aside from the obvious?</s>
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.</s>You don't have to be a jerk.</s>
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.</s>Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.</s>Yes, sir. Trust is a two—way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.</s>
What are you going to do?</s>I'm going to call the police.</s>No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--</s>
That's it?</s>Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --</s>You think so?</s>Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.</s>
Good-bye.</s>Good-bye.</s>
What the fuck do you have to complain about?</s>Don't even start.</s>No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.</s>Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.</s>You sold it? I thought they stole it.</s>Sold it, stole it, whatever...</s>Motherfucker...</s>Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.</s>You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.</s>Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.</s>You just don't fucking get it, do you?</s>You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?</s>What the fuck is that supposed --</s>I mean, that's what I heard --</s>You got something to say --</s>
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.</s>Tell me about Frank Ligourin.</s>Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.</s>
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.</s>I'm not getting a ticket.</s>
Hey Jack, join us.</s>No thanks.</s>Don't worry, I won't report you!</s>I don't gamble.</s>
It's Johnny Cammareri.</s>Johnny.</s>
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....</s>You're not a pain in the ass....</s>Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.</s>
My daughter, Rachel.</s>Yummy.</s>Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.</s>Really? Care to make a wager on that?</s>Good luck, Sebastian.</s>What, nervous I'm going to win?</s>Would you please leave.</s>
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.</s>Relax. It will be fine.</s>
It's been totally charted.</s>We just talked.</s>Sure.</s>Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.</s>
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.</s>I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.</s>What do you add up to here?</s>One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.</s>A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.</s>So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.</s>The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.</s>No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.</s>Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.</s>I bet.</s>
What are you doing?</s>He doesn't answer.</s>
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.</s>Sure.</s>You're the one who found the bodies?</s>Yes.</s>Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?</s>No, nothing.</s>You knew these people?</s>I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.</s>So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?</s>Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.</s>I see. Then what brought you up here?</s>
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.</s>Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.</s>What's the matter with my printing?</s>
You mean like techniques?</s>Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?</s>
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.</s>We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.</s>One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...</s>Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...</s>Yeah, maybe...</s>
My stockings.</s>Yes?</s>Take them.</s>
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.</s>Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?</s>
You all sure about this?</s>Follow me.</s>
You got a chisel round here?</s>If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.</s>
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?</s>I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.</s>She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!</s>That is incredible.</s>Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.</s>I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.</s>I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?</s>
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --</s>And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?</s>
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.</s>Un sapo?</s>Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.</s>Yes.</s>But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.</s>With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.</s>
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.</s>You know what this tape could do if it gets out.</s>I've got a good idea, yeah.</s>People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.</s>Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.</s>
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?</s>Shut up!</s>
They're out of Glenlivet.</s>What else is going on?</s>
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.</s>I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.</s>But you didn't hurt --</s>No.</s>Because you didn't love him --</s>That's right.</s>
No, they won't -- I won't let them.</s>Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.</s>Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --</s>
Joe! You *told* him to!</s>Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.</s>
Do not turn your back on me.</s>You are really going to force this, aren't you?</s>Either you are with me or against me.</s>
Who is that idiot?</s>Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!</s>
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...</s>Y'mean take off our costumes?</s>Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...</s>Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?</s>You first.</s>
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?</s>You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.</s>
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."</s>Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.</s>
Oh, it breaks the heart.</s>And the head.  You hit me, Dad!</s>I'll never forgive myself --</s>Don't worry -- I'm fine.</s>Thank God!</s>
I found her in bed with someone.</s>Who was he?</s>She.</s>
You want it coming back with us?</s>You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.</s>
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...</s>Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...</s>
John.  It's good to see you.</s>Good to see you, Ma.</s>
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...</s>I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...</s>
Too bad.</s>It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!</s>All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.</s>I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!</s>
I don't see the point in that.</s>Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --</s>
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?</s>Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.</s>
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?</s>In here?</s>Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.</s>Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.</s>
Should I just take the documents now?</s>If you want to do it.</s>
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.</s>Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.</s>GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!</s>
There's no way of knowing.</s>Perfect...</s>It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.</s>
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.</s>Thanks.</s>
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.</s>My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.</s>His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?</s>
Have you ever had anal intercourse?</s>Yes.</s>With how many people?</s>Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.</s>Were they wearing condoms?</s>Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.</s>
It could all be coincidental.</s>There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.</s>
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.</s>Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.</s>... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.</s>Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.</s>Yes... I know, Chauncey.</s>I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...</s>He does...?</s>Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?</s>
Hungry?</s>Just some coffee.</s>I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...</s>Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.</s>Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.</s>I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.</s>She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?</s>Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.</s>
Well? Is it just the pump?</s>Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!</s>
Yes?</s>Puffed cheese?</s>No thank you.</s>I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--</s>Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?</s>No.</s>Then let's assume I don't.</s>Yes sir.</s>
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!</s>Why didn't you give a warning signal?</s>Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.</s>
Well, then there's only one thing to do.</s>What?</s>Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.</s>
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.</s>We're leaving.</s>The fuck you talking about?</s>Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...</s>
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?</s>Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...</s>
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.</s>Dell -- show me that on a screen.</s>
I'm sorry. That is not my business.</s>It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?</s>
Answer your mother.</s>Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?</s>
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.</s>I might.</s>That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.</s>
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?</s>No. Here's fine.</s>Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?</s>
So...  That your first time?</s>Yes'sir.</s>You struck some gold, didn't ya?</s>
Will he understand Spanish?</s>His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.</s>
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?</s>Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.</s>
You go set down by the River.</s>Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!</s>Get along with you.</s>
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.</s>I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?</s>I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?</s>
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.</s>I thought we would meet alone.</s>I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.</s>Some water.</s>
Goodbye.</s>Oh, my...</s>
I hope you find the figures correct.</s>I hope so, too.</s>M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--</s>For more than forty years. So Madame told me.</s>And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.</s>

So what did you think?</s>It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?</s>Yeah.</s>
What does this guy want?</s>He'd like to kill me.</s>
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.</s>It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone.

You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.</s>Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.</s>

I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.</s>I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...</s>I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?</s>No.</s>He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?</s>...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?</s>I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that.

What's that?</s>The fucking New York Times.</s>
Grateful!?</s>"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."</s>That's it!</s>
Where does he work?</s>Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.</s>
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.</s>Me?  Why me?</s>Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?</s>I saw an article...</s>I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.</s>

Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie --</s>No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?</s>Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?</s>Of course not --</s>No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.</s>Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.</s>Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?</s>Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.</s>I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.</s>Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.</s>You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.</s>You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.</s>Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.</s>Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?</s>And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!</s>
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!</s>I'm finished.</s>Finished!</s>

Risky business, isn't it?</s>...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...</s>There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!</s>
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'</s>This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.</s>But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..</s>

I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons.

What do you think it is?</s>I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.</s>You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.</s>
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?</s>Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...</s>
Your relatives must've taught you something.</s>NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.</s>
Didn't you get anything?</s>I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.</s>

It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up.

Merciful death.</s>He jests.</s>Why does he call you that?</s>Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.</s>
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...</s>What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?</s>I don't-.</s>You do know. Try.</s>
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.</s>Dad, can I talk to you about track?</s>

Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.</s>Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.</s>It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.</s>Is that why you brought him? Because of me.</s>
General --- ?</s>We must combine our strength.</s>
Come on, just get to the message board!</s>I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...</s>
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?</s>...Both maybe?</s>
Don't make me have to use this.</s>I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.</s>
And don't start crying.</s>I'm not crying.</s>
Please --</s>Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.</s>
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.</s>Yeah? Have a brandy?</s>Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.</s>I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.</s>That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.</s>Yeah? What's his name?</s>Victor Laszlo.</s>Victor Laszlo?</s>
Excellent.</s>You think he'll like it?</s>He'll love it.</s>
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?</s>A bruised lip.</s>
Double down.</s>What?!?</s>Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.</s>I know, but...</s>You gotta do it.</s>...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...</s>If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...</s>
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.</s>Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?</s>Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.</s>
There's ... another exit?</s>Aye, for us there is.</s>
So, Ramona!</s>Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.</s>
Ticket!  What's going on?</s>She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...</s>A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!</s>
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!</s>James, why don't we...?</s>Lock it now!</s>
Not a pressing issue.</s>I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?</s>Uh... gym.</s>Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?</s>Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.</s>But you enjoyed it, yes?</s>Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.</s>Cheerleading.

Andy, who is that guy?</s>I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.</s>Dick Laurent?</s>Yes, I believe so.</s>But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?</s>He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?</s>
Whatever.</s>Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.</s>
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.</s>And still not a thing to watch.</s>
Careful of that edging there...</s>Yeah, I got it.</s>
What'd you find out?</s>The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --</s>Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?</s>It was stolen.</s>
What the fuck are you talking about?</s>That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.</s>
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?</s>I'll keep that in mind.</s>
Since when did you guys start changing tires?</s>Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.</s>Seems not.</s>If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?</s>Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.</s>Mind if I have a look?</s>
He got better.</s>I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.</s>
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.</s>Sir?  What did he say?</s>Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.</s>
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?</s>No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!</s>
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.</s>Thank you, ensign.</s>No problem, lieutenant.</s>
You don't look so bad in this light.</s>Why do you think I brought you here?</s>I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.</s>Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.</s>Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?</s>How do you think I got here?</s>
This is easy.</s>Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.</s>Why?</s>
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.</s>Billy, how are you?</s>Son of a bitch. Get over here.</s>
Ready to go, Mama!</s>Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.</s>
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.</s>That's true.</s>Then there's the other issue.</s>What's that?</s>You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.</s>I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.</s>And nobody else can do that?</s>Not the way I can.</s>That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.</s>Don't confuse what we do with who we are.</s>I just need to go a little slow.</s>
What do ay say?</s>Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.</s>
Are you just doin' this to punish me?</s>Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.</s>
You give me ulcers.</s>That's my job.</s>
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?</s>She seems very nice.</s>Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -</s>Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?</s>Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.</s>
What a filthy job!</s>Could be worse!</s>How?</s>Could be raining!</s>

What did that cost?</s>You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.</s>Doesn't.</s>
What do we do?</s>What do we do?    Lean into it.</s>What the hell does that mean?</s>Actually... I don't know.</s>
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?</s>Well, there's a lot riding on this project.</s>
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!</s>Willie, come on!</s>
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.</s>It does look good.</s>
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?</s>Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.</s>Yeah?</s>Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.</s>You do not want me to do your cover.</s>I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.</s>You're not serious.</s>I'm always serious.</s>Oh they'd never let me do what I want.</s>I get final approval. It's in my contract.</s>Would I get paid?</s>Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.</s>Yeah?</s>Yeah.</s>Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.</s>
I'll think about it.</s>Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!</s>
See her?  Get anything?</s>For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.</s>And?--And?--</s>--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.</s>Were you eyebrow reading?</s>It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?</s>
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.</s>I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?</s>We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.</s>
See ya.</s>Later.</s>
See anything?</s>No.</s>
Is anything wrong?</s>No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!</s>
But I gave it to you!</s>Well what am I gonna do with it?</s>I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.</s>You really want to help me?</s>
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.</s>I'm just nervous.  Sorry.</s>You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.</s>He already did once.</s>
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...</s>Okay, I follow you so far...</s>Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.</s>You're joking.</s>To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.</s>
Bribing me again?</s>And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?</s>
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.</s>The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.</s>Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.</s>
Where are we going, Frank?</s>Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.</s>Frank?</s>You want to see him too, right?</s>Yes, but.</s>Then, shut up!</s>
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.

What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?</s>He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.</s>

What <u>about</u> a crowbar?</s>What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.</s>
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?</s>It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.</s>Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.</s>I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?</s>Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,</s>Can you make a deal with them?</s>Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.</s>Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.</s>
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?</s>I thought everything.</s>
It's in my bag.</s>You have cash. What do you need me for?</s>C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.</s>Cost you a thousand for the bond.</s>I know that.</s>

He's not glowing.</s>Hit the lights again.</s>
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.</s>Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.</s>
B-3.</s>Miss.  G-6.</s>Ohhh!  You sunk it!</s>Heh-heh.</s>Are you peeking?</s>Oh, quit your whining and pay up.</s>
Ten minutes.</s>I'll be here.</s>
You have a question for Helmuth, David?</s>Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?</s>
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight...</s>I can't do it...</s>Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?</s>Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.</s>Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.</s>
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.</s>If that's the way you want it.</s>That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.</s>Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.</s>
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.</s>I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.</s>
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?</s>Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.</s>My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.</s>Don't you want answers?</s>There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?</s>
Ahhhhhhhhh!</s>Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.</s>
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --</s>Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --</s>That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --</s>I don't understand --</s>It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?</s>I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.</s>
Finally.</s>-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --</s>
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.</s>I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.</s>It stings a little.</s>A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.</s>
Where are you going?</s>To bed.</s>'To bed'?</s>Yes.  I'm tired.</s>
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?</s>I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.</s>
You were wrong, it did hurt.</s>But not for long...</s>
Where do you want this?</s>What is it?</s>Phonograph.</s>Storage.</s>
Hey, Eve!</s>Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"</s>Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.</s>Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?</s>I certainly do!</s>Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?</s>No it's not!</s>Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...</s>Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!</s>Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--</s>Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.</s>Well...yeah. Okay.</s>
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?</s>Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.</s>
So you live in Chicago now?</s>Yup.  Not far from here, actually.</s>
Mother?</s>Yes... Derek.</s>
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!</s>Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.</s>
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...</s>That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.</s>
Tom.</s>Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?</s>Marge has been telling us about the rings.</s>You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.</s>Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.</s>
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?</s>He's a boy, dude.</s>
Don't you have school?</s>Nope.</s>
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.</s>Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.</s>
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.</s>Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.</s>
How do you play reality.</s>It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.</s>Strip reality! How do you play that?</s>It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.</s>You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.</s>Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...</s>
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --</s>Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.</s>The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!</s>No, not Louis!</s>Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --</s>I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!</s>But why?</s>Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.</s>
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.</s>All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.</s>That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.</s>Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.</s>
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.</s>They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.</s>
It was lying where on the balcony?</s>Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.</s>We do, when we get the chance.</s>
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?</s>Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?</s>
One of yours?</s>No, sir.</s>If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.</s>
Jim, are you all right?</s>No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.</s>Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.</s>
Listen-</s>Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.</s>
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.</s>You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.</s>Don't worry about what we used to be.</s>How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.</s>What's my name?</s>What?</s>I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?</s>Special Agent Jones.</s>Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.</s>
I'm retired.</s>Good.  That's real good.</s>
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...</s>There's no time for this bullshit...</s>
What happened to him?</s>I don't know. He moved away.</s>
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?</s>It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?</s>Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?</s>I'm really only equipped to take orders --</s>Well can you connect me to someone else?</s>Well what's the situation?</s>Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?</s>I'm here, I'm listening.</s>OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....</s>
Dear, whatever shall we do?</s>Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!</s>
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?</s>You don't know him -</s>You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.</s>

Hey, where's Erica?</s>I don't know.</s>

My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?</s>Your pocket?</s>The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.</s>Right.</s>

Her car is gone.</s>What car?</s>
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.</s>Didn't Charles have any friends?</s>Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.</s>At least he knows how to behave at funerals.</s>
He said what?</s>"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.</s>No one else heard it?</s>He whispered it in my ear.</s>
We are so fucked.</s>Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.</s>

I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...</s>Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back – with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?</s>
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.</s>Why don't you just call him?</s>I dunno.</s>Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.</s>Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.</s>
You know, I was the one who created Hell.</s>I know, your wickedness.</s>I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.</s>
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.</s>Bobbie, what are you talking about?</s>O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.</s>
Where we going?</s>I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.</s>Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?</s>
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.</s>Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."</s>
So.</s>What you mean, so?</s>If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.</s>
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-</s>May I see your license, please?</s>Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...</s>
There is nothing.</s>Reach out farther. Call to her.</s>Lyssa ... Lyssa ...</s>
What? Deep down inside?</s>Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.</s>I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --</s>I don't think so...</s>Why not?</s>Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.</s>There's always exceptions.</s>Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.</s>
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-</s>The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.</s>We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...</s>
What?</s>You're lying.</s>What makes you say that?</s>You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.</s>Are you always sucha good judge of character?</s>
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?</s>We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?</s>Mad, Ma?</s>Sometimes they do.</s>No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.</s>Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?</s>No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.</s>Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son</s>
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.</s>Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?</s>
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -</s>Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.</s>Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.</s>
Why?</s>Just wondered... what happens?</s>Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?</s>
Who? Elizabeth?</s>Yes.</s>You mean you're still in contact with her?</s>No.</s>But you're planning to be?</s>I don't know. Possibly.</s>Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?</s>Not entirely.</s>But that was part of it?</s>Yes.</s>Like maybe a big part?</s>Possibly.</s>Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?</s>I don't know.</s>Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?</s>I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.</s>Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.</s>As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.</s>Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?</s>
She finally got in--</s>It's Saturday.</s>You got in late last night.</s>Yeah. I had uhm--school business.</s>
WHAAAATT?</s>Don't forget to set the alarm.</s>
You should come into the shelter.</s>I'm quite all right, thank you.</s>Look over there.</s>
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?</s>Stephanie.</s>Nice.</s>
We have a problem here?</s>Jack Foley, famous bank robber.</s>
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.</s>We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.</s>We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.</s>I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.</s>
Someone's falling.</s>It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.</s>
I saw the flag signal--what's up?</s>Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.</s>You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?</s>I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.</s>Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.</s>If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?</s>Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?</s>John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.</s>Follow the money. Always follow the money.</s>To where?</s>Go on.</s>This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.</s>You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?</s>I did everything you said, but it all seemed--</s>--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.</s>What's the whole thing about--do you know?</s>What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.</s>Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?</s>Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, "What's the trick?" And he replied. "The trick is not minding."</s>
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...</s>Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.</s>
One minute.</s>I think this is about where we came in.</s>This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.</s>i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...</s>
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?</s>Nope.</s>
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?</s>Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.</s>Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!</s>Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.</s>
A whole lot, Frankie.</s>Like what?</s>Like a home, for one thing.</s>You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!</s>Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.</s>What 'you signifyin'?</s>I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.</s>
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?</s>Oh, we gonna be friends now?</s>What do you know about dating a single mother?</s>
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?</s>Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.</s>
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.</s>The Black Pearl is a real ship.</s>No, it's not.</s>Yes it is.  I've seen it.</s>You've seen it?</s>Yes.</s>You've seen the Black Pearl?</s>Yes.</s>You haven't seen it.</s>Yes, I have.</s>You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?</s>... No.</s>No.</s>But I've seen a ship with black sails.</s>Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?</s>... no.</s>Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!</s>
How long have you been setting up?</s>About 22 hours on site.</s>Nice work.</s>
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.</s>Do you want us to come with you?</s>I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?</s>
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -</s>Why did you do this?</s>I don't know!  I'm sorry!</s>
Where's the dog?</s>My husband's out looking for him.</s>He run away often?</s>That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?</s>
I did at that.</s>And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?</s>Aye.</s>I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.</s>
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.</s>Thank you...</s>I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.</s>Sir...?</s>And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.</s>I don't understand.</s>
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --</s>Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.</s>
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.</s>Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.</s>
Now?</s>Light him.</s>
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.</s>Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?</s>
Well, look here!</s>Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".</s>
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.</s>Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?</s>Sure - I think so, Stew.</s>I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?</s>How is her family going to feel about it?</s>Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?</s>
Oh Brad, I'm mad.</s>Dammit, Janet.</s>
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.</s>What time did you make it for?</s>Eight.  That okay?</s>
Highliner, please.</s>That's on us.</s>
John! What are you doing here?</s>I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?</s>Promoting that action movie I did...</s>
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?</s>We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.</s>What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.</s>
C-4?</s>More bang for the buck.</s>
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.</s>Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?</s>
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?</s>Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.</s>
It must be one of these...</s>Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.</s>
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.</s>Just take deep breaths.</s>All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.</s>
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.</s>God bless you.</s>
Huh?</s>I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.</s>
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...</s>Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?</s>It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...</s>So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?</s>The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.</s>No, we were patients.</s>
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -</s>Nicky, I'm sorry.</s>
You okay?</s>Sure.</s>
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.</s>That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.</s>
Yes, Patrick?</s>Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.</s>
Have you seen my wallet?</s>It might be in the kitchen.</s>
Promise me you will never leave me.</s>I cannot promise you that.</s>Promise me.</s>I will never forgive you.</s>I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.</s>I don't understand you.</s>Promise.</s>Promises mean nothing.</s>Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.</s>All right -- I promise.</s>You are my old friend.</s>
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?</s>Well... here.</s>In my apartment?</s>It's my apartment.</s>Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!

I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!</s>You were a tiger last night.</s>And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.</s>Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.</s>So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita.

You can't write it?</s>I can write it.  I can't type it.</s>
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.</s>Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.</s>I didn't either. What the fuck is it?</s>
That's where we make our scene.</s>You think they're watching?</s>Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.</s>
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!</s>How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?</s>The Lord will provide.</s>
Where's Emily, Hank?</s>I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.</s>I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.</s>
Think you can sleep?</s>Are you gonna steal my shoes now?</s>No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.</s>
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?</s>You.  What' you're doing --</s>And what am I doing?</s>I wish I knew.  You're hiding.</s>Hiding what?</s>Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.</s>
Is my daddy okay?</s>The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?</s>I think so.</s>I need your help with something.

If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?</s>You'll wreck your raincoat.</s>

...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?</s>Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.</s>
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.</s>Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?</s>I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...</s>JTS...?</s>What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.</s>I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.</s>Are you an artist?</s>No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.</s>

For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.</s>

It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money.

I am right! I know I'm right!</s>Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.</s>
How'd they get onto you?</s>How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!</s>

I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.

Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.</s>And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?</s>No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself.

And why.</s>
Nice car.</s>I'm glad you think so.</s>You don't like it?</s>No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.</s>

I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.</s>And what is that?</s>The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?</s>I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.</s>I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.</s>
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?</s>Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.</s>What makes you so sure?</s>

Only God can point the finger, Loretta.</s>I know what I know.</s>And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do.

They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.</s>What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?</s>It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.</s>Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.</s>Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.</s>You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...</s>No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.</s>Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.</s>That part of me is dead.</s>

Is this real?</s>Yes.</s>I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?</s>Real McCoy.</s>You're a preacher?</s>I was a minister.</s>Was? As in not anymore?</s>Yes.</s>Why'd ya quit?</s>I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.</s>I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?</s>Yes.</s>I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.</s>How do I know you'll keep your word?</s>Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.</s>You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.</s>Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?</s>Yes.</s>Didn't like it, did ya?</s>No, I didn't.</s>Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.</s>You won't let him touch her?</s>I can handle Richie, don't worry.</s>
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.</s>Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!</s>

You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.</s>...Who?</s>The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.</s>But, you told me yourself...</s>It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.</s>What do you want me to do?</s>To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.</s>What is it?  Can I help?</s>The old man will never bring in the New Year.</s>

Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.</s>He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.</s>

Murphy to Epps.</s>Epps.</s>You just shoot at something?</s>Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.</s>
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?</s>Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.

You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?</s>Say what and so what.</s>Did one of the officers work you over a little?</s>

I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.</s>
Our last game is this Saturday.</s>No shit.</s>
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?</s>I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?</s>

Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!</s>What do you mean, Jack?</s>I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.

Who is Don?</s>Don? Are you in with them?</s>No. But you're in very big trouble.</s>Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?</s>I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?</s>Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?</s>Yes.</s>Or do you just want me?

Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.</s>Man, I wanna smoke a joint.</s>
Who the hell made up that law?!</s>You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.</s>
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.</s>Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --</s>
Can he do that?</s>HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.</s>
Randy Stetz?</s>That's right.</s>
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.</s>The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.</s>
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!</s>He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.</s>
Tom?</s>Yeah.</s>
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?</s>You don't think I had anything to do with it?</s>Where were you?</s>
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.</s>Who are you? Who are you REALLY?</s>I am the One who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.</s>
Eddie, which dress do you like better?</s>I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?</s>
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?</s>The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.</s>And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.</s>How are Molly and the boy?</s>Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!</s>
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.</s>Of course...</s>
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.</s>The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?</s>Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.</s>I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.</s>First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.</s>You forgot "sexy".</s>No, I didn't forget "sexy".</s>Just didn't get around to it, huh?</s>Oh, Tom, please.</s>Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.</s>Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?</s>More people watch it.</s>Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,</s>No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...</s>Just what?</s>Kidding around... you know, fun.</s>
God help you, Lynette!</s>You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!</s>No! That's not true!</s>
Never answer the phone.  Ever.</s>Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.</s>Did you buy some clothes?</s>I got a dress, yeah.</s>Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.</s>It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.</s>Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?</s>No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.</s>This isn't a date.</s>Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?</s>The Rex.</s>Any good?</s>I think you'll approve.</s>... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.</s>Thank you <u>very much</u>.</s>
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.</s>Uh, fourteen.</s>Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.</s>This is stupid.</s>C'mon.</s>In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.</s>Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?</s>I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.</s>
But...I've seen you.</s>When? When did you ever see me use?</s>This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?</s>You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?</s>
You coming?</s>In a minute. Get us a table.</s>
Are these your bags?</s>Yes, just the two.</s>
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?</s>Yes.</s>What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?</s>Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.</s>We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?</s>
I'm so sorry.</s>Please, don't do that...</s>
Are you marked like this??</s>Why?</s>I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--</s>
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.</s>The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.</s>
Under the table.</s>I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.</s>
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...</s>What?</s>I don't understand --</s>Did you say rape her?</s>-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.</s>What did she say?</s>Let me go.</s>You've got to tell me what she said.</s>
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?</s>I don't know.</s>It was a stupid thing to do.</s>It was.</s>Welcome Home.</s>You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?</s>Sure.</s>
Someone's there.</s>What?</s>In the window.  Norman's at work.</s>I don't...</s>
You want to hit the town tonight?</s>I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.</s>What do you have? A Pluto call back?</s>Sure. Kick me when I'm down.</s>
...No.</s>Maybe it's the draft through the door.</s>
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.</s>Okay, Jim. I understand.</s>Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.</s>
You don't look so good.</s>I gotta headache... What's goin' on?</s>The police called us.</s>Yeah? what did they want?</s>They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.</s>But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?</s>
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?</s>Somewhat.</s>Where does it make berth?</s>Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.</s>The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?</s>Why ask me?</s>Because you're a pirate.</s>And you want to turn pirate yourself?</s>Never.  They took Miss Swann.</s>So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.</s>
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.</s>He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...</s>"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?</s>I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...</s>Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...</s>Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...</s>The homeless!</s>How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!</s>
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...</s>It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-</s>Ain't it the truth?</s>Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...</s>Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-</s>They're your fans, your audience-</s>They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!</s>
I'm Cindy.</s>I'm Hanson the caretaker.</s>
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!</s>No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.</s>
You okay?</s>Yeah.</s>You don't look so okay.</s>
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?</s>Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.</s>
Maybe we should call a doctor.</s>No.  I'm okay.</s>
What?</s>They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.</s>Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?</s>
Where you comin' from?!</s>Uh... basement I think...</s><u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!</s>
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...</s>I can make this wall without --</s>... two... one... MARK!</s>
You actually listen to all those tapes?</s>No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?</s>A little less than yesterday.</s>In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?</s>John died.</s>I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.</s>You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.</s>That's not true, Parker.</s>If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.</s>What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?</s>Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.</s>You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...</s>Go to hell.</s>It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.</s>Enough!</s>
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?</s>If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.</s>
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.</s>Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?</s>Three Jacks.</s>That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.</s>
No...</s>No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?</s>She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.</s>
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.</s>Babe ought to get him drunk again.</s>
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.</s>Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.</s>
Yes ma'am?</s>If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?</s>Yes ma'am, I do.</s>Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.</s>Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.</s>
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!</s>I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!</s>
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!</s>It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.</s>I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!</s>
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!</s>Hm.  What a lump.</s>
Maybe I ought to go out there.</s>You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.</s>
You are despicable.</s>I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.</s>

...How ya doin' there, Scotty?</s>Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?</s>It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.

They'll understand us, all right!</s>Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.</s>
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.</s>Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.</s>
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?</s>What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.</s>What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.</s>Do you miss Mallory?</s>Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.</s>Then was it worth it?</s>Was what worth it?</s>Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?</s>
This is all too familiar.</s>Over here.</s>
Getting there.</s>I got eggs down here!</s>Good d--</s>
Son?</s>Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.</s>
Ya know what, Fred?</s>What?</s>
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --</s>There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.</s>
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.</s>I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.</s>
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!</s>I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...</s>
Any survivors?</s>Negative.</s>
Happy now?</s>I won't be happy until you leave town.</s>Why?</s>How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?</s>What sort of questions?</s>The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.</s>Like what?</s>Like how'd you get this car? That suit?</s>I have money.</s>
Don't help me.</s>He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt?</s>
Chuck, let's go.</s>You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.</s>
We kept it...</s>Is that right?</s>
What are you going to do!?</s>This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.</s>
Why did you catch that?</s>Because it was going to fall.</s>You're certain?</s>Yes.</s>But it didn't fall.  You caught it.</s>
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?</s>Sure, boss.</s>I'm not your boss. Not anymore.</s>
The food doesn't please you?</s>It's lovely.  It's just...</s>This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.</s>I... we are humble people...</s>Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.</s>You would do that, your Majesty?</s>My dear, I've already done it.</s>
I feel sick.</s>Imagine how he feels.</s>
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...</s>They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...</s>
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.</s>Thank you for saying so.</s>
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.</s>So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.</s>Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.</s>Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?</s>Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.</s>
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.</s>Don't even try to remember.</s>
Hurry!</s>I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.</s>
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?</s>A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.</s>I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?</s>
It's been a long time.</s>Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.</s>Some of the old songs, Sam.</s>Yes, ma'am.</s>
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.</s>You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.</s>We were supposed to be together.</s>How can I be together if I'm not together?</s>You're on somethin' again, aren't you?</s>James...</s>When am I going to see you?</s>
With their shields down it might be possible.</s>Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.</s>
Who are you?</s>Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --</s>You.</s>Me.</s>
We'll pretend it never happened.</s>So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?</s>I don't hate you.</s>Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.</s>And? What are you saying?</s>And. It's wrong.</s>And who says what is wrong.</s>And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.</s>What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.</s>So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..</s>Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.</s>Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.</s>
No.</s>Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?</s>
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...</s>And what do you want for Christmas?</s>Just you.</s>
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...</s>Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.</s>
I'm on the run!</s>What's happened?</s>The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.</s>Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?</s>That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!</s>
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?</s>I... I don't believe this.</s>Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.</s>Who the hell is this "they?"</s>Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?</s>No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!</s>So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.</s>Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.</s>You should watch what you say.</s>I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!</s>Kid, that cuts no ice with them.</s>What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?</s>They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.</s>Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!</s>Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.</s>I was decorated.</s>I know.  A Purple Heart.</s>Exactly.</s>You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.</s>At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!</s>You can't testify.</s>Why not?</s>

Wilson.</s>Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?</s>What?</s>Did you hear what I said?</s>Yeah, but I don't know --</s>-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?</s>No.</s>Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.</s>I didn't realize it was that loud.</s>And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?</s>Yeah.</s>You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?</s>
The kitchen.</s>Very nice.</s>
I thought you said she was going with us?</s>Let's just go sailing, okay?</s>Want to talk about it?</s>Want to swim home?</s>
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?</s>We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.</s>
Why not?</s>He's my brother.</s>You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.</s>
Put that back.</s>But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.</s>
...and?</s>They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.</s>

Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...</s>Now -- er --</s>Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...</s>Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.</s>
Congratulations, sir.</s>What?</s>Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.</s>

No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.</s>Seems like there's more of it than ever before --</s>Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?</s>I don't know. I can assume...</s>Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?</s>I'm not sure.</s>And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?</s>Video.</s>Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?</s>
This isn't working out for me anymore.</s>Yeah, me neither.</s>
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?</s>All finished.</s>
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.</s>Fuck do you want?</s>I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.</s>Really?</s>Yes. Under two conditions.</s>What're those?</s>That you meet with me twice a week--</s>

But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.</s>

But you have to learn to live with it...</s>I live with it every minute of every day.</s>I know that --</s>You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.</s>It wasn't your fault, Alex.</s>Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...</s>Do you find her?</s>
Do you think she will give us the designs?</s>Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.</s>And you think O'Brien is that leverage?</s>That remains to be seen.</s>
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?</s>No.  What's this lawyer business?</s>

I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.</s>This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.</s>There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.

The guy's insane.</s>It's a fine line between insane and inspired.</s>Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...</s>No.</s>Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.</s>No.  He's not depending on luck.

Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?</s>Nope, there's no way.</s>Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?</s>Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.</s>In other words, I'm fucked.</s>In so many words, yes.</s>It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.</s>I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.</s>

You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.</s>I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?</s>
Did I say something?</s>No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.</s>
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.</s>OK...</s>

When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.</s>It shouldn't be too much longer.

Jesus...</s>How well did, er, do you know him?</s>Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother".

You have a great voice.</s>Really, do you think so, really?</s>Yeah!</s>Yeah?</s>It's terrific.</s>Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.</s>
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.</s>And what would you do?</s>Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.</s>
Do that again.</s>What.</s>Smile.</s>
Annie, what is it?</s>The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.</s>

We're going to think about it.</s>It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.</s>
I'm sorry.</s>For what?</s>Not believing you.</s>You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.</s>
How was school today?</s>Fine.</s>
What's your opinion?</s>It's hard to say for certain, these things are--</s>I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?</s>Yes sir.</s>Then what's your goddam opinion?</s>Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.</s>Get it.</s>
Not time yet.</s>Make it time.</s>
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.</s>I'd a found you, Ma.</s>
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.</s>Thank you, sir.</s>Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.</s>
When I wanted to.</s>It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.</s>
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.</s>Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.</s>Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.</s>

Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?</s>Right.</s>Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?</s>Right.</s>Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.</s>Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...</s>Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...</s>And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!</s>What could I be?</s>You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?</s>Here you are.</s>All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?</s>
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.</s>Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.</s>
This it?</s>Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.</s>
Bad boy....</s>I didn't do it on purpose....</s>
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?</s>Don't they have to be?...</s>
You're a good friend.</s>You, too, sweetie, the best.</s>
Now where are you going?</s>Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.</s>

Where does the Chief get the drugs?</s>I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.</s>Rio de Janeiro, maybe?</s>Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?</s>That's Brazil.</s>Yeah. Maybe.</s>Wait here for me, Gummy.</s>
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!</s>What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.</s>He didn't look unhappy!</s>
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.</s>Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.</s>How about "later?"</s>
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.</s>I have to get back.</s>
I have the permit.</s>After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?</s>To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.</s>
How much longer?</s>Shhh!</s>I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.</s>In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.</s>
Thank-you.  The real world.</s>Look at those eyes.</s>
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?</s>Behind in your dues? How much?</s>I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.</s>Well?</s>But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-</s>Oh-oh.</s>She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...</s>
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -</s>- We all want what we can't have?</s>Not all of us, 007.</s>
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.</s>...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.</s>Excuse me sir.</s>
Goodbye, Francis.</s>Goodbye, Harry.</s>
Open the door.  Please.</s>Why don't you shoot off the lock?</s>

She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.</s>Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.</s>You think she was really there?</s>Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.</s>
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.</s>Miette, come here and relax.</s>
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.</s>You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.</s>Thank you!</s>Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.</s>Disappointed?</s>No--proud. Very proud!</s>
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?</s>I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.</s>
Jesus, Lindsey--</s>Bud, something really important is happening here.</s>Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--</s>Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!</s>
I'll be watching over you.</s>Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.</s>
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!</s>My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.</s>
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?</s>Somewhere down there?</s>Wonder where Powell and Carney are?</s>We'll have to look for them later.</s>
It was one year ago...</s>It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.</s>I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.</s>To get out of Southport?</s>Right. Now I remember.</s>
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.</s>Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...</s>Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.</s>
I am really sorry about this.</s>I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.</s>What?</s>Shoot the radio!</s>
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.</s>Go for it.</s>If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?</s>I won't have to.</s>
You're not tired of it?</s>I am, as a matter of fact.</s>
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?</s>Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.</s>I have to go face to face.</s>
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.</s>And they get caught!</s>That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.</s>
Mornin', Jabez ...</s>Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.</s>Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.</s>Some other time, Stevens.</s>
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.</s>Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.</s>This is about Cuba.</s>
I am Satan. I am your God, now.</s>MPH RM!!!</s>

Lava?</s>No.</s>What are they?</s>I don't know.</s>
Michael.</s>Yeah?</s>You want to come here a minute?</s>
This seat taken?</s>Thank you.</s>
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?</s>Sleeping.</s>You remember Margie Fogg?</s>From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?</s>How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.</s>We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?</s>Yeah.</s>
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.</s>What is your name, young lady?</s>Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.</s>What did you say?</s>Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E...

Have some more wine, Frank.</s>Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.</s>
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?</s>Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!</s>Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.</s>
What the hell happened?</s>He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -</s>Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!</s>It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!</s>
Graham is an unusual name.</s>Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.</s>Oh, uh-huh.</s>Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?</s>No, I think you look... fine.</s>Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.</s>Well...</s>I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?</s>No, not really.</s>Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.</s>You play an instrument?</s>No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?</s>Oh, I like it. I like it very much.</s>What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.</s>Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...</s>
Let's go.</s>No, wait here.</s>
That kid's the great white hope.</s>I could get it out of him.</s>You're not listening.</s>
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.</s>But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.</s>

Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.</s>Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.</s>That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.</s>The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.</s>
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...</s>In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.</s>
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.</s>Thank you.</s>
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!</s>Come on.  Let's get out of here.</s>

Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?</s>Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.</s>The squeaky wheel gets the oil.</s>No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.</s>Thank goodness.  Breaktime.</s>
Hi.</s>Hi.</s>
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.</s>Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...</s>
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.</s>I seem to remember knocking on your door.</s>And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.</s>Sit back.</s>
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.</s>I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.</s>I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."</s>Uh-huh. What are they?</s>Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.</s>One hundred books?</s>It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.</s>What happened?</s>
Are they following us?</s>Yes.</s>Gulp!</s>
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.</s>How'd you know?</s>They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die.</s>
Nice piece of work.</s>Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.</s>
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.</s>The police station.</s>He'll be pulp by now.</s>
What do you think about when you're having sex?</s>With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.</s>
Ready?</s>I'm ready.</s>Then let's do it.</s>
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?</s>Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.</s>Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.</s>
Scottie, why are we here?</s>I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.</s>But why? Why here?</s>Madeleine died here.</s>
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?</s>No, she isn't.</s>
Laudanum!</s>Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.</s>
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.</s>I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.</s>Don't talk to me like that.</s>Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.</s>Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?</s>Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...</s>I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--</s>Be my guest.</s>That's disgusting.</s>
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.</s>Does that mean we have to cut him loose?</s>Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.</s>
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.</s>In real life when does he hit you?</s>My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?</s>
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.</s>My fault.</s>You're not hurt, are you?</s>I don't think so.</s>I wish you'd make sure.</s>Why?</s>Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.</s>Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.</s>Thank you.</s>Who are you?</s>Now, really -</s>
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -</s>Charles.</s>
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?</s>That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.</s>
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.</s>Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?</s>No. Hell no.</s>
Can't you take a guess?</s>Well...not for another two hours.</s>You can't take a guess for another two hours?</s>No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!</s>
I need it.</s>Now?</s>Now.</s>
Whoa. What was that?</s>What?</s>Your mom made a move on me.</s>She did not.</s>Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.</s>LLOYD, she's my mom.</s>I can't help my heart.

Buttlick!</s>Where did you learn that word?</s>I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!</s>Kids.</s>
What's in there?</s>POWs.  And their families.</s>So I'm supposed to be ...</s>Compassionate.  Grateful.</s>Proud?</s>Sir?</s>Of them.</s>Yes, yes.</s>Fire him.</s>
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.</s>Right.  Got lost in the rocks.</s>We'll get the other one, though.</s>
Did you say something?</s>No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?</s>Rob.  Don't be childish.</s>Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.</s>I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.</s>Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?</s>
Do they come in dreams, these visions?</s>Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.</s>Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.</s>
Yeah.  A real moron.</s>Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.</s>
My heart stays here.</s>And mine goes with you.</s>
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?</s>I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...</s>Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?</s>I didn't mean to --</s>Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.</s>I hear she was a terror to work with.</s>She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.</s>
Dead.</s>He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --</s>
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.</s>What do you expect me to do about it?</s>I just thought you'd like to know --</s>Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --</s>
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.</s>We ought to be suing him.</s>

Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?</s>Could you believe that crazy elephant?</s>
This is it? The whole vault.</s>'Fraid so.</s>Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.</s>
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.</s>Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.</s>

What's this -- ?</s>Cadillac.</s>
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.</s>What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.</s>Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?</s>Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!</s>
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.</s>I would never do that.</s>I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.</s>
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.</s>I will...</s>

Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?</s>Just that I was in the Marines.</s>The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.</s>
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.</s>It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.</s>You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.</s>Yeah.</s>
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.</s>But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.</s>Yeah...</s>
What are you running from?</s>Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...</s>If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.</s>Why do you hate me?

A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?</s>Yes.</s>Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them — I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.</s>
Oh my God...</s>God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.</s>
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?</s>Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.</s>
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.</s>You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.</s>That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.

Jesus...</s>Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.</s>

Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.</s>That's me.</s>Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...</s>Nine.</s>Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.</s>You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.</s>

Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.

Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?</s>

When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...</s>It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.</s>

Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?</s>What did you say?!</s>
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.</s>There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.</s>You're very macabre.</s>It's my birthday.</s>Happy birthday.</s>Thanks.</s>

In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.</s>Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --</s>But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.</s>Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.</s>When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.</s>I'll commit that to memory.</s>
This is Elmer, our longest serving...</s>Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.</s>

I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.</s>Junk?</s>You know... it's parts...</s>I know what junk is.</s>Yeah?</s>We definitely want it to have junk.</s>Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.</s>
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.</s>Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.</s>You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.

It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.</s>What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.</s>

Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?</s>I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.</s>But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.</s>I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.</s>

And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.</s>Yes, you're right.  It will be done.</s>
Where are all the mediums?</s>Frida, grab that red one.</s>
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?</s>I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.</s>I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage.

What's funny?</s>This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.</s>As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.</s>
Hello, Brad -</s>Emily -</s>
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.</s>That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.

I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.</s>

Krypton!</s>Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?</s>
You live here.</s>I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.</s>Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?</s>The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.</s>What kind of deal?</s>The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.</s>I didn't realize I was out.</s>Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.

What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?</s>I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.</s>If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.</s>That's my girl...  Lights.</s>

"</s>And so what?</s>Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?</s>Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.</s>Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.</s>What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.</s>
Are you alright?</s>Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?</s>
They let you out?</s>Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm?

You're gullible and you're gutless.</s>No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend.

Did you think she was gonna use it?</s>I don't know.</s>You don't know?</s>No.</s>Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?</s>No.</s>
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.</s>Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.</s>
Just leave her alone.</s>I'm so sorry.</s>Leave her alone.</s>
We made it!  Damn, we made it!</s>You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.</s>With great pleasure.</s>

There's plenty of other things I could be doing.</s>Such as?</s>Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?</s>

How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?  Well, the truth is - we can't.  So what am I saying?  Will we find her again?  Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.</s>

What...?</s>I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.</s>

That's puttering, sir.</s>No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?</s>Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.</s>Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?</s>Yes sir.</s>Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.</s>Yes sir.</s>How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?</s>You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.</s>Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?</s>Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.</s>A bird in a gilded cage?</s>Yes.</s>That's all I wanted to know!</s>

Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?</s>What do you mean?</s>You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?</s>No way... Would you?</s>I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.</s>That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.</s>No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?</s>No. I never feel like that.</s>I do.</s>

But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.</s>One believes -— it's like any other religion...</s>I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.</s>It seems right to us.</s>I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?</s>Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --</s>I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation.

Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?</s>Are you trying to insult me?</s>Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.</s>Well, you shall see.</s>When is she supposed to return?</s>I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.</s>She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.</s>My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.</s>
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?</s>I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.</s>

Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood.

All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.</s>The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.</s>I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.</s>
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...</s>How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...</s>
What do you mean?</s>I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?</s>
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.</s>Another woman?</s>Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.</s>You know who it was?</s>The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--</s>
To who?</s>Doesn't matter.</s>C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.</s>
We may have a chance.</s>Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.</s>We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!</s>All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!</s>
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.</s>Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?</s>Right in front of the room.</s>Fine.</s>
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?</s>Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet.

So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.</s>Oh no, no...</s>Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure.

Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?</s>Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.</s>Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.</s>It belonged to my dad.</s>

But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.</s>Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.</s>I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...</s>
Roy --</s>Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!</s>
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.</s>Right. What about condoms?</s>Professor!</s>Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.</s>Would you please focus?</s>Fine.  What's all this stuff?</s>Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.</s>
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.</s>What?</s>Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.</s>It was a somewhat extraordinary day.</s>I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...</s>

Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.</s>I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important.

But, I'm here.</s>Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--</s>--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...</s>Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!</s>

Will you have a cigar?</s>No, thank you.</s>

I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.</s>Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!</s>
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.</s>I don't know.</s>
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.</s>You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!</s>
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?</s>It could be.</s>I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.</s>The old boy shot by the highway?</s>Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.</s>That's very linear Sheriff.</s>
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.</s>I know.  I can feel it too.</s>
Well, where do they hold court?</s>Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.</s>
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.</s>Print is dead.</s>That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?</s>Is that a game?</s>It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?</s>I collect spores, molds and fungus.</s>Oh, that's very - unusual.</s>I think it's the food of the future.</s>Remind me not to go to lunch with you.</s>
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.</s>I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!</s>

We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.</s>And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity!

You are perfectly healthy.</s>That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.</s>Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?</s>Yes.</s>Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!</s>
So what do you use, then? A stake?</s>Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --</s>
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.</s>Basically...</s>Sire!</s>
My brother's car!</s>All right. Die, Granada Jocks!</s>
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?</s>No, not at all, Mr. Jason.</s>
Who is that other guy?</s>Another contractor.</s>Someone hired both of you?</s>No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.</s>So this is something between you and him?</s>He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.</s>Why?</s>Because he is trying to retire me.</s>He wants to kill you?</s>Yes.</s>Why?</s>The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.</s>And you want to use me to get him?</s>Yes.</s>Forget it!</s>We don't have a choice.</s>
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.</s>What do you care about?</s>I care about my daughter.</s>
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?</s>No. But I've got a penknife.</s>Hay—in my teeth.</s>

Thanks. Cheers.</s>If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?</s>I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.</s>
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...</s>Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!</s>

You can't talk underwater!</s>I bet you hear everything I say!</s>
The witch?</s>It's not about witches, goddamnit!</s>
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?</s>Oh, sure.</s>
City hall?</s>You must not remember anything. Come on.</s>
Nix, the law!</s>Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!</s>
Come on, let me drive.</s>I'm fine. You rest.</s>I feel like driving.</s>

I guess he misses a lot of dinners.</s>But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --</s>Anyday...</s>
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?</s>I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.</s>I don't believe that.</s>It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.</s>Ten years ago.</s>Yes.</s>What happened?</s>I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.</s>What did he want?</s>He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.</s>What did he say?</s>He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.</s>Was that it?</s>Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.</s>You didn't take it.</s>No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.</s>Ten years later, here you are again.</s>Yes.  Here I am again.</s>
What is it with you people and pain?</s>We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.</s>
How did you know?</s>Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.</s>
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?</s>Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?</s>
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...</s>That's it?  Is that it?</s>
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.</s>Anyway, thanks for helping me out.</s>I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you.

This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.</s>First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.</s>
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.</s>Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.</s>
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.</s>We'll have to pick up a copy.</s>
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.</s>My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?</s>
Then?</s>Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.</s>
These are really cold, huh?</s>That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.</s>
What are you doing here?</s>Fixing a leak under your sink.</s>
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...</s>That means closing the beaches.</s>
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.</s>Whom?</s>
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.</s>I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.</s>Yeah.  I'll get some ice.</s>
Where the hell are you going?</s>Unfinished business.</s>And what about the reconfiguration?</s>Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.</s>
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?</s>I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.</s>
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?</s>Perfect.</s>You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.</s>I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?</s>I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.</s>
We better stick here till tonight.</s>Yeah.</s>
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.</s>We got it locked in the sock.</s>Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.</s>You ol' sack of guts.

But how did it happen?</s>You'll never find the answer for everything God did.</s>I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?</s>But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.</s>But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.</s>She is an innocent.</s>But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.</s>That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?</s>That's what I have to believe...</s>Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?</s>
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.</s>What is he doing here?</s>Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?</s>

You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!</s>New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?</s>
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.</s>And now...?</s>Now...I don’t...</s>
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.</s>I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?</s>Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.</s>It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.</s>
Oh my God!  She's in there!</s>Daddy help!</s>

If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.</s>I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.</s>Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.</s>If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.</s>
What are the Chevalier's intentions?</s>I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.</s>
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?</s>Right now?</s>Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.</s>Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep.

Walter, we'll pick up here next time.</s>I want to talk about it now.</s>We'll talk about it more on Thursday.</s>Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?</s>Go home, Walter.</s>Now I know.

Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?</s>I love secrets.</s>That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?</s>I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.</s>It's bullshit.

I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.</s>Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!</s>They won't.

I don't find this very funny,</s>So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.</s>Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.</s>Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?</s>Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.</s>I see your point... though why should I care?</s>I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.</s>Sounds intriguing.</s>She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.</s>
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."</s>They were safe and could sleep.</s>
Now this is getting exciting.</s>Remember to roll his balls around a bit.</s>

No.  Not true...</s>C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.</s>
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.</s>Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.</s>
What is that tune?</s>I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?</s>
Hurry up!  Jump in!</s>There was a girl with them...If I could find her....</s>
Call me.</s>Tonight. Let's get together.</s>Okay.</s>

Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?</s>I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.</s>Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.</s>They're okay.</s>You alone, or you got confederates?</s>I'm not alone.</s>How many you got in there?</s>I got Sal.</s>Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?</s>Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?</s>
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?</s>I didn't say when I want to die -</s>
Do you know where they are?</s>Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.</s>
Where is Miss Wollsten?</s>She's in her room.</s>
I'm out of ammo!</s>I'm out of fuel!</s>
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --</s>Finding out where she is.</s>How can you do that if she's already off the line?</s>I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.</s>
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.</s>Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.</s>
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.</s>I don't know ...</s>

Farm Route 17!</s>Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.</s>You don't say.</s>Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in.

Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'</s>'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'</s>
Your silence intrigues me.</s>John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.</s>
What you doin', son?</s>It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.</s>

Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.</s>We have to talk.</s>Good luck. You can't even think in here.</s>
Reverend Mother?</s>Yes?</s>Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?</s>
I've found her, Westchester Mall.</s>I'll go.</s>
What.</s>There's been some trouble downtown.</s>What kind?</s>What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."</s>Our black friends?</s>No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.</s>I thought he was in prison, in England.</s>Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.</s>
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.</s>Look, I told you inside--</s>--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.</s>

Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.</s>I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.</s>Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?</s>I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.</s>
...and I think I know why.</s>Why?</s>Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.</s>This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?</s>Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.</s>A book on the warehouse murders?</s>A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.</s>
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.</s>I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.</s>Cheese is particularly troublesome.</s>Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?</s>Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?</s>Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.</s>

Your kind of people.</s>What do I get out of it?</s>If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.</s>You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.</s>
Let's have lunch!</s>Righto!</s>

Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?</s>What good will that do?</s>Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.</s>Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.</s>
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!</s>That's enough, Yvonne!</s>
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?</s>Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.</s>Not all heroes wear masks.</s>
No, no it's okay.</s>It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...</s>...very difficult to get in.</s>Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.</s>

Not only physical, but also psychological.</s>I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.</s>That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.</s>
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?</s>For a year?</s>For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.</s>
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.</s>That's life.  My kisses are alive.</s>Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?</s>

She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.</s>So the guy's not a sicko.</s>If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.</s>Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?</s>Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?</s>That's where it gets a little strange.</s>And what about the guy that was following me?</s>Now you're really getting paranoid.</s>
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!</s>Take it or leave it.</s>

He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.</s>For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!</s>Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.</s>And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.</s>

We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.</s>Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.</s>Then why ain't he dead?</s>They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.</s>Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.</s>

You know French?</s>Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada</s>Guess who just signed up for a tutor?</s>You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?</s>You could consecrate with her, my friend.</s>

Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!</s>Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.</s>No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.</s>
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.</s>Now?</s>Better today than tomorrow.</s>Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.</s>
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.</s>Double merde.</s>

Catherine!</s>I'll get her...</s>
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.</s>The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.</s>Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.</s>
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.</s>Uh-huh.</s>I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.</s>Yeah.</s>That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.</s>
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?</s>He wouldn't move.</s>
Hurry up.</s>4732...?</s>Too low.</s>
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?</s>Carpe Diem... seize the day.</s>Very good, Mr._?</s>Meeks.</s>Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?</s>
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...</s>I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.</s>You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.</s>That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...</s>
I've seen worse.  Much worse.</s>Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.</s>
Your call is come through.</s>Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.</s>
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?</s>What of it?</s>He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.</s>
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.</s>Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.</s>
You finish the reading for E-con?</s>Yeah.</s>What'd it say?</s>Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.</s>Whatever, big head.</s>
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?</s>Unicorn -- a kind of animal --</s>What do they look like?</s>Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.</s>Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?</s>No.</s>How about California?</s>Would they be good to eat?</s>Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...</s>Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...</s>
Will you consider that?</s>Yes. Yes, I will.</s>
Are you sure we should be doing this?</s>Come over here.</s>You said never to touch you before a fight.</s>If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.</s>You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...</s>Come here.</s>
I got it.</s>It's on the college.</s>
Which is what?</s>At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.</s>
They're waiting for him to walk in.</s>You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.</s>
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.</s>Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.</s>Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.</s>Assuming your mysterious nun in right.</s>I've heard crazier things this week.</s>All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.</s>The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?</s>They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.</s>Who would know where they were hidden?</s>There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.</s>
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?</s>I guess I...uh...regressed.</s>
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?</s>Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.</s>
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.</s>The real story on Miss Carpenter.</s>All the gory details.</s>

I was hoping I'd get to meet you.</s>You mean, you knew about me?</s>
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?</s>Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.</s>It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -</s>But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.</s>All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.</s>

Personal effects...</s>Timex...</s>
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.</s>Did you try?</s>Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!</s>
How come her own mom isn't helping her?</s>Cause her own mom's real sick, too.</s>
Where's he from?</s>Barnes comes from Hell.</s>
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece.

Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?</s>You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.</s>Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.</s>I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.</s>Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.</s>Yes, I gathered as much.</s>And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.</s>Yes.</s>And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.</s>Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.</s>But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.</s>By fire.  That's the best way, really.</s>

You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.</s>You killed them.</s>
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?</s>Cute, Evan.</s>
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.</s>All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!</s>
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.</s>Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.</s>
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.</s>You what?.. What are you talking about?</s>We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...</s>
What time is it?</s>It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.</s>Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.</s>

Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!</s>Star Wars?</s>
Yes.</s>Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.</s>A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.</s>
What sort of puppy are you looking for?</s>What sort have you got?</s>Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?</s>Yeah.</s>We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?</s>Yes... Good, good...</s>So, what are you looking for?</s>What about an untrained pup, white...</s>How much of a hurry are you in?</s>Tomorrow?</s>I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...</s>I see. How much?</s>Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.</s>... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.</s>Have the money ready by 11am. We’ll call you.</s>
So what makes you think he'll play for us?</s>We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.</s>Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.</s>He can move in here with us.</s>

How do you think I got to be a colonel?</s>Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.</s>Do whatever they tell you--</s>I mean, follow orders, sir.</s>With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.</s>I do, sir.</s>Because it's a job?</s>Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--</s>Chaos.</s>
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?</s>One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.</s>And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.</s>That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?</s>Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.</s>But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.</s>If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose.

You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.</s>Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."</s>No.</s>Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.</s>No. I understand perfectly.</s>Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?</s>Just one. Why is this floor so short?</s>Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.</s>

So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.</s>Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.</s>
Jeremy would have never killed himself.</s>Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.</s>This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.</s>
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?</s>That was my idea.</s>You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?</s>
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.</s>Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.</s>The workers don't get on?</s>Get on?

All right...  Come along.</s>What?</s>Go ahead of me -- the both of you.</s>
What the hell do you want?</s>I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -</s>I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -</s>They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.</s>
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!</s>You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you.

This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.</s>Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.</s>Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.</s>When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?</s>Shortly after she came to us.</s>And you weren't shocked?</s>I was appalled, just as you are now.</s>And what happened?</s>She stopped eating completely...</s>

See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on.

That was rather.... disappointing.</s>I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.</s>I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !</s>But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.</s>I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.</s>That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".</s>What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?</s>Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.</s>That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.</s>Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.</s>
Somebody loan it to you?</s>Yeah.</s>
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.</s>He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?</s>Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.</s>You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.

Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?</s>

Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?</s>In the other man's rectum.</s>Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?</s>

You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.</s>And his baggage?</s>Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.</s>
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.</s>Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?</s>
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?</s>You up to it now?</s>Sure. Let's get it over.</s>One thing I have to caution you about.

Those are the Hoyts.</s>I don't care. They're out.</s>Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble.

Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...</s>Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."</s>
It's a special day isn't it?</s>Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.</s>
You have had girlfriends?</s>Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.</s>
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.</s>He will.  He has great faith.</s>But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.</s>

Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."</s>You put it very well.</s>You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?</s>Entirely.</s>Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.</s>
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.</s>So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.</s>Not this one.

No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.</s>It's the only way.</s>I refuse.</s>You're frightened.</s>No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.</s>
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.</s>No.  I'm fine.</s>It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.</s>

Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall.

I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --</s>Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.</s>It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.</s>And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.</s>That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel.

Do you think it's a possibility?</s>Yes.</s>How can you say that?</s>That wasn't the answer you wanted?</s>Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?</s>

I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.</s>I wanted to.</s>Good-bye, Dad...</s>
How did he manage to do that?</s>Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.</s>
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.</s>I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...</s>Loud.</s>Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.</s>I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.</s>Isn't therapy helping at all?</s>I don't know.

Ah.  Ah.  Ah...</s>I hurt you?</s>
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.</s>Because?</s>Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.</s>And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?</s>Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.</s>Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....</s>

Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.</s>
Piggyback ride.</s>I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.</s>

That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?</s>Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?</s>Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --</s>What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?</s>
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.</s>We're going to work on the message.</s>This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.</s>The most logical choice.</s>You don't have a shred of evidence!</s>

Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.</s>The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.</s>I had a teacher like that once.</s>Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...</s>Who wants true? Who wants moving?</s>Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.</s>Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.</s>I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.</s>I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.

I've never met anyone like you, Betty.</s>I know, that's why we were meant to be together...</s>No, I mean your dedication scares me...</s>It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...</s>Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...</s>...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...</s>Thanks.

He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.</s>Why won't he wait until the bank closes?</s>He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.</s>What?  What if he brings it with him?</s>
Told you, did he?</s>Yes.</s>
This way, Daphne.</s>Now you tore the other one.</s>
Are you okay?</s>Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.</s>That's always tough. How long were you together?</s>Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you?

What is this place?</s>This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?</s>I was on Earth...</s>Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?</s>Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...</s>
What are you doing?</s>Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?</s>You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?</s>
It's noise.</s>It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?</s>

Walsh here?</s>He's in the dark room.</s>
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.</s>Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.</s>
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell.

Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --</s>He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.</s>

Let me go!</s>Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.</s>
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.</s>Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.</s>
Why?</s>We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.</s>The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?</s>
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?</s>Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--</s>Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?</s>No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--</s>
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?</s>I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.</s>
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...</s>It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?</s>Not as good as Nino's.</s>You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?</s>Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?</s>I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.</s>On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?</s>We moved out after that. Upstate.</s>Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?</s>They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.</s>You married?</s>Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.</s>

Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.</s>You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!</s>Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?</s>
You know, I've thought about that, actually.</s>No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.</s>
We have no Juliet!</s>No Juliet?!</s>

Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.</s>Really?  Too bad.</s>She thinks you're with Simone.</s>Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.</s>I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.</s>Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?</s>Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.</s>I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?</s>I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.</s>

Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --</s>No.</s>Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?</s>Everybody's got some, I guess.</s>Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?</s>No.</s>Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.</s>
What was I saying?</s>About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...</s>

Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.</s>Come on, you know the words, sing along.</s>No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.</s>
That's right.</s>We do.</s>To Oz?</s>To Oz!</s>
Where's my paycheck?</s>Have you been logging on?</s>What?</s>I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.</s>Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?</s>You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.</s>
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.</s>What... what do you mean?</s>It's out of your hands.</s>
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.</s>No. I like it here.</s>
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...</s>'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'</s>You said it.</s>
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.</s>Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.</s>

Could he have been at all conscious?</s>I understand...</s>
I'm leaving Vanessa.</s>What?</s>It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...</s>
Not even a little bit?</s>I already told you I'm not.</s>When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...</s>Um...</s>Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...</s>
Who'd you call?</s>No one. I didn't have the number.</s>
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.</s>I'll just set it right here.</s>

Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?</s>At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.</s>Mother!</s>I can make my own decisions.</s>
What's going on?</s>Rain.</s>Real rain?</s>Yeah ... You don't have rain either?</s>
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.</s>Yeah...something.</s>

A gust of wind killed him.</s>Yeah, and what put him up there?</s>Hey, you weren't there.  Right?</s>
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?</s>They were vampires?</s>Same one.</s>Oh.</s>
They bloody hurt me.</s>You're lucky. They kill as well.</s>And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?</s>
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.</s>I thought you were watching him.</s>We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.</s>So what happens now?</s>We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.</s>What about me?</s>What about you?</s>Do you think I took some of that money?</s>I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.</s>
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.</s>...Why?</s>Remember Lyle Barton?</s>
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.</s>I got dry cleaning.</s>We'll pick it up.</s>

Hello...</s>Jack! It's Jani.</s>
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...</s>Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.</s>I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.</s>
What are you doing, Travis?</s>I been told to take your car in, Sir.</s>Why?</s>I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.</s>
You're going to blow yourselves up.</s>Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.</s>You don't know that.  It could be a trick.</s>If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.</s>

You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?</s>I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.</s>
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?</s>How'd you know?</s>
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.</s>In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?</s>Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.</s>Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?</s>It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.</s>
Looks quiet, y'know.</s>I think it's closed.</s>I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --</s>
Lenny, give them the tape.</s>It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...</s>

Spoken like a press agent.</s>I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...</s>Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...</s>Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...</s>... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-</s>Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.</s>
I've been waiting for you, baby.</s>Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?</s>
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?</s>Loretta, shut it.</s>Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.</s>Shut it up, Loretta.</s>Oh, Christ, it's true.</s>

I presume you won’t want to take the boy with you when you’re finished?  There’s a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?</s>
What the fuck!</s>You said it looked like a car accident.</s>What the fuck!</s>I'll pay for it.</s>
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?</s>Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.</s>

I never had a choice.</s>What?</s>You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.</s>You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!</s>I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.</s>
Tell me you'll call.</s>Okay.</s>Will you?</s>I said I would...</s>But, will you?</s>Are you still on mediction?</s>Why would you say that?</s>
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.</s>Come on.  I want you to see something.</s>You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?</s>I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.</s>
Feeling better, Oz?</s>I'm such a loser.</s>That's the spirit.</s>

I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.</s>You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.</s>Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .</s>
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.</s>And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.</s>Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.</s>I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.

Communicate?</s>Tell you my secrets.</s>

Now let's forget everything except that we're together.</s>That's right.</s>
What?</s>We need to get past them.</s>

Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.</s>Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.</s>
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.</s>What you did is dead wrong.</s>Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.</s>Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.</s>Let me ask you a question, if I may.

You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.</s>There's nothing to talk about.

And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!</s>Makes you gag.</s>Gag on your own invention, then.</s>Oh, come now...</s>You invented this, this...</s>
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...</s>No fuckin' lie...</s>...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...</s>
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.</s>Best speed, Scotty...</s>
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.</s>What's that supposed to mean?</s>I don't know.</s>
How long are you staying?</s>A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.</s>Was that difficult to get?</s>No. Mother Superior told me to come.</s>
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.</s>But that doesn't add, does it.</s>No it doesn't.</s>Because Iris knew somebody was after her.</s>
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.</s>As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off.

Includin' me.</s>Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?</s>I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.</s>
Thought you had a skirt earlier.</s>I got others.</s>
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?</s>It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.</s>Then, close the case.</s>I better keep looking.</s>Where, how?</s>I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.</s>You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.</s>It's got to make sense some way.</s>

You have that, too?</s>No. Ours was damaged.</s>What's in those files?</s>The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?</s>You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.</s>
Leon, I would like to ask you something.</s>Anything, Ninotchka.</s>If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.</s>I promise... I swear.</s>Did you make any change in this room?</s>I don't think so.</s>When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?</s>

So I'm a bachelor.</s>
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.</s>Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.</s>

I wanna walk.</s>It's a long walk.</s>I got time, Bert.</s>You want me to tell her for you?</s>Tell her what?</s>You gotta be hard, Eddie.</s>
What the hell are dreams, anyway?</s>Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.</s>
You okay?</s>Yeah.  How'd you do.</s>
She's not here.</s>Where is she?</s>She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.</s>

Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?</s>Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.</s>
Why did you come back here?</s>... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.</s>And, what about us?</s>I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?</s>I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?</s>I'm trying.  I'm really trying.</s>
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.</s>What do you want from me?</s>Something I guess I can't have anymore.</s>Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen.

Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.</s>How nice.</s>It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.

Hey... you got a fine one right here!</s>Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?</s>
Even Rene?</s>She's the toughest to read.</s>Maybe she's telling the truth.</s>Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises.

Did you think it was so special?</s>I told her it was the fuck of the century.</s>
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.</s>You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?</s>The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.</s>Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?</s>
How shall we get out now, Leon?</s>Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!</s>

Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?</s>Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.</s>No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam.

You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.</s>So, that's it, eh?

The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.</s>And the ten thousand?</s>Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--</s>
Are you sure it can't hurt us?</s>Nothing can. Not ever.</s>

In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.</s>But we saw Earth destroyed.</s>And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.</s>

You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.</s>It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.

They know their world is never gonna be the same.</s>What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?</s>Then you get Mom the hell out.

Hello. Hello.</s>Who was it?</s>Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.</s>Are you all right?</s>No.</s>Then let's spend some money.</s>
You think this'll cheer Dad up?</s>Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.</s>
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...</s>About what?</s>This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!</s>Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...</s>
No.</s>At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.</s>Does that mean I'm in?</s>I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.</s>What'd you say?</s>I said you're soft.</s>Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.</s>
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?</s>What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.</s>
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?</s>Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..</s>
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.</s>You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?</s>This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.</s>What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!</s>Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.</s>Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.</s>Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?</s>What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.</s>I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!</s>
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.</s>So go get 'em, Dad!</s>I'm too weak. The process has already begun.</s>
You are on drugs.</s>Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.</s>Are they paying you for all this?</s>Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.</s>Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.</s>... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?</s>
Is that what you think?</s>Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.</s>
You look nice. I should have dressed.</s>You're fine like that, Mom.</s>There's hot cider in the kitchen.</s>Thanks.</s>I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.</s>Me neither.</s>
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.</s>Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.</s>I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.</s>
Who ever said sanity was fun?</s>It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.</s>Promise?</s>Promise.  As long as we have steak.</s>Steak?</s>
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?</s>No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.</s>Well, don't get carried away.</s>I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.</s>Good, I love swinging a shovel.</s>
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.</s>Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.</s>
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!</s>Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!</s>Okay!</s>
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!</s>Maybe it had something to do.</s>Shit!</s>
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?</s>We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.</s>No, you were middle class, like all Americans.</s>I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.</s>In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.</s>
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --</s>If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!</s>I don't want neutral...I want dead --</s>
What'll I tell Fran?</s>Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.</s>
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.</s>Yeah, sure, I understand.</s>
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.</s>Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.</s>Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.</s>
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--</s>There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.</s>Doesn't mean you had to marry her.</s>We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.</s>Okay, good reason.  Then what?</s>It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.</s>She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.</s>Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!</s>
His what??</s>His schwanzstucker.</s>Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.</s>
You show Claire these sketches?</s>Yes.</s>Did she throw up?</s>That isn't very nice.</s>Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?</s>I can't tell.</s>Why not?</s>She won't stop crying...</s>Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.</s>
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...</s>You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!</s>No...</s>Did God forbid you to tell the truth?</s>No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.</s>
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.</s>Find out who they are?</s>Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.</s>Interesting.</s>Yeah ... and they both use the same address.</s>Where at?</s>Palmdale.</s>Damn, that's a long drive.</s>
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.</s>Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.</s>The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...</s>Get to the point, will you...</s>My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...</s>
Gold could be arranged.</s>For Munro children?</s>Yes.</s>How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?</s>The King? The King has mountains of gold!</s>
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.</s>You's the novelty, Champ!</s>Give my main man a raise!!</s>
Dead?</s>Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.</s>Maybe he's not dead.</s>He?</s>The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.</s>And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.</s>
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.</s>Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.</s>Old values. Buy.</s>
Nice.</s>The music? Or the fire?</s>
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.</s>I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...</s>
Nice joint. Can you afford it?</s>Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.</s>What for?</s>For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.</s>Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.</s>
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.</s>How long would you need me?</s>Two weeks.</s>What's the pay?</s>What's fair?</s>I've got to make at least a thousand a week.</s>
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.</s>C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.</s>I just want to be alone.</s>All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."</s>
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!</s>But you don't have any kids!!!</s>All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!</s>
You sure you don't need any help in there?</s>No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.</s>
Who knows?</s>Where do you want it?</s>This side.</s>
Spaceship.</s>Alright Buzz, get ready...</s>
Corn gonna shoot at me?</s>Nope.</s>Then I love it.</s>
Reed's gonna fix me up --</s>For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.</s>Skeptical...?</s>
That's odd...</s>What?</s>
So... for how long do we have to...</s>Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?</s>
We--</s>...cannot go on the air.</s>
-- I was just trying to finish some work!</s>You mean you've actually begun some?</s>
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.</s>You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.</s>Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!</s>
Nothing like that will happen between us.</s>Maybe we ought to ask Stella.</s>
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.</s>I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...</s>
Lisa, please!</s>There's nothing to see.</s>There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!</s>Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.</s>It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?</s>You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?</s>What are you getting at?</s>You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?</s>Yeah.</s>Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?</s>That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.</s>And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.</s>
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?</s>No, it's just little Bingy Baker.</s>
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.</s>That's okay.</s>Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.</s>Where is everybody?</s>We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.</s>Why aren't you there?</s>I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.</s>That's too bad.</s>"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?</s>What if I said you?</s>What if I said goodbye?</s>Why would you wanna do that?</s>Why do you always answer a question with a question?</s>I'm inquisitive.</s>I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?</s>
Yeah.</s>Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.</s>Yeah.</s>
You took my workers.</s>They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.</s>When?</s>I don't know.  Soon.</s>
Right?  Buddy?</s>I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.</s>Oh.  Oh, that's good.</s>But we're not on my planet, are we?</s>No.</s>
Boy, you're really into this.</s>He is one of the great poets.</s>
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.</s>Only because I got pulled out early.</s>Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.</s>
...I can't do it, Wally...</s>Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?</s>What?</s>Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...</s>...I...</s>Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.</s>
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"</s>Straight up.</s>Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.</s>Shit. I knew you were crazy.</s>I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.</s>
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?</s>It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.</s>Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.</s>By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.</s>I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.</s>Give me back my comb.</s>I don't take orders from anyone.</s>Give it back.</s>
I hope you're comfortable.</s>Yes. I am.</s>These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.</s>Yes. He's a very careful driver.</s>... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?</s>It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.</s>I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?</s>Your family doctor?</s>Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...</s>I agree.</s>Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?</s>
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.</s>I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...</s>
-- White ladies?</s>-- Oh my yes.</s>
I just can't stand this.</s>Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.</s>It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.</s>But all he had was chocolate milk.</s>I mean him.</s>
They must work on the section gang.</s>That's right.</s>Well, they seem just like everyone else.</s>Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.</s>
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?</s>Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.</s>That a fact?</s>Yeah.  It's a fact.</s>
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.</s>I did too.</s>
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?</s>Growls a reserved greeting.</s>Right.</s>
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!</s></s>
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!</s>No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.</s>
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?</s>All of the above, man...  And then some.</s>
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.</s>Yes, papa.</s>
Where are you?</s>In here.</s>

That was him.</s>Yes.</s>You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.</s>
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:</s>Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?</s>The bridge...?  I'd better get going!</s>
What?</s>He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.</s>I'm in charge.</s>
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?</s>I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.</s>Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?</s>I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.</s>Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?</s>Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.</s>Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --</s>The system would collapse.</s>I believe in that system...</s>Do you?  Really?</s>
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.</s>You're better than candy.</s>I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.</s>

I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.</s>Amazing you made it this far.</s>
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!</s>Rose, you are too uncritical of people.</s>You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.</s>He did?</s>Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?</s>Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.</s>He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?</s>Yeah, I'd believe it.</s>Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.</s>Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.</s>I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.</s>
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.</s>How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?</s>A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.</s>I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.</s>Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.</s>

Fuzzy face is gone.</s>Yes, please continue.</s>I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the “Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the “Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat…</s>

Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?</s>Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.</s>
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.</s>Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.</s>Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.</s>Sure, I'll take her up right now.</s>
That's not the point.</s>You said whatever it was you would understand.</s>That was before I found out what it was.</s>
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.</s>Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.</s>And where did they get married?</s>
Well?</s>If she is, the machine works.</s>The machine works.  She is.</s>
I'll be in touch.</s>No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.</s>
Hello?</s>Oh.  Sorry.</s>

Well?</s>Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.</s>You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?</s>I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?</s>What did Dr. Fulton tell you?</s>
I'm sorry I asked.</s>No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.</s>That's an answer.</s>Damn right.</s>For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.</s>Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"</s>Why not --</s>Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --</s>I think so.</s>Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.</s>
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night</s>With Mark?</s>He still likes you</s>Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?</s>He did?</s>Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.</s>Businessman?</s>Businessman!</s>Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.</s>Yeah, yeah, OK</s>Yeah</s>So why are you dating Jonathan?</s>
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.</s>I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.</s>You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.</s>
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...</s>What?</s>My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.</s>You're right.  It does sound strange.</s>
A fanciful idea, Mister White.</s>Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.</s>
Hi.</s>Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.</s>I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!</s>
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.</s>They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.</s>I'm by way of being a medical myself.</s>A doctor?</s>A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --</s>
Excuse me Miss?</s>What!</s>A man to see you.</s>What man?</s>
I'd kill ya.</s>From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot</s>Don't try me.</s>Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.</s>No way.</s>C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--</s>
He's moving his fingers!</s>Of course. He saw you moving yours.</s>But perhaps he understood --</s>
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...</s>Show's over.</s>
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?</s>Uhh...</s>Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.</s>
That's right.</s>Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.</s>That is so right.</s>Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?</s>Now, that's really stupid.</s>So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?</s>
We can't really bring another family in here with us.</s>Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.</s>When did you talk to Harry?</s>Don't shout!</s>
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.</s>When?</s>About three months before I met you.</s>Why?</s>
What's wrong?</s>I don't know who I am.</s>What do you mean? You're Rita.</s>I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!</s>
Hang on, hang on.</s>Let's go!</s>Go.</s>
Directing suits you.</s>I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.</s>It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.</s>Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.</s>Just did.  Jealous?</s>When does he graduate high school?</s>Oh, very jealous.</s>
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!</s>I had to test you.</s>But you threw a knife at my head!</s>And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.</s>I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!</s>
Is there an ashtray in here?</s>No.</s>Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.</s>
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!</s>Open the goddamn door!</s>
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.</s>But, miss ...</s>
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.</s>Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.</s>
What's he say?</s>Someone died here. It's tapu.</s>But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.</s>
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.</s>A cheap trick.</s>Cheap but effective.</s>
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?</s>He's just loaded, honey.</s>I was talking to Jim.</s>Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--</s>
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.</s>Yeah, thanks for everything.</s>
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.</s>Is that what it is?</s>You're damn right that's what it is.</s>
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?</s>Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.</s>All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.</s>Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.</s>Which I didn't have.</s>And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.</s>
How's it look, Marge?</s>Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.</s>Yah.</s>You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?</s>No way.</s>
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...</s>She calls him Tommy...</s>Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.</s>
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.</s>Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.</s>I know. It would be almost inconceivable.</s>But not completely inconceivable?</s>I suppose it isn't logically impossible.</s>I guess it isn't.</s>Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.</s>
I'm saving them for a rainy day.</s>gives her a sympathetic look.</s>I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.</s>They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."</s>looks startled at the outburst.</s>I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.</s>We don't want to tire you out, dear.</s>stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.</s>Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?</s>
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.</s>Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.</s>
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....</s>I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...</s>
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?</s>I'm not sure.</s>George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.</s>But it's more than just that, am I right?</s>
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.</s>Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?</s>Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.</s>What?</s>I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.</s>Well, what is it?</s>If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?</s>Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.</s>
What is our approximate distance?</s></s>
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --</s>Of course I knew.</s>
How about this?</s>Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.</s>
This spells trouble.</s>I have a guest.</s>
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--</s>--Christ almighty--</s>--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--</s>--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--</s>--a six week bun in the oven--</s>
Buddy...</s>Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.</s>
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.</s>But I might not have.</s>Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...</s>I'm touched.</s>You fucked us over.</s>The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.</s>I was making a point.</s>What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?</s>Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.</s>You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.</s>Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."</s>
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.</s>Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.</s>I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.</s>A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.</s>If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.</s>Scattered, smothered and covered.</s>Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.</s>
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!</s>I can certainly think of one more!</s>
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -</s>Enjoyed it?</s>I guess I got carried away</s>My son, I foresaw this. I knew -</s>No! You couldn't imagine -</s>How good it felt!</s>How good it felt -</s>
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.</s>A sin against <i>what?</i></s>Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?</s>
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.</s>Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.</s>
Don't forget your CDs.</s>Those aren't mine.</s>Sure they are.</s>They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...</s>Okay, okay.  I get the picture.</s>I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.</s>I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.</s>You're being deliberately obtuse.</s>I guess I am.</s>Well, think about it.</s>
About what?</s>I want to have a look around before I take you.</s>'Take me'...?  Where?</s>It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.</s>'The one' to do what?</s>Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...</s>Get what?</s>Time.</s>What the hell are you talking about?</s>Watch it!</s>I'm sorry --</s>In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.</s>
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?</s>I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.</s>Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?</s>
Let's make a little music, Colorada.</s>NO!!!</s>
